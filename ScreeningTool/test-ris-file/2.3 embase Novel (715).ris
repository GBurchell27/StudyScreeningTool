N2  - Objective: To assess the effects of mother-infant yoga groups on the motor development of preterm infants, anxiety, postpartum bonding, and quality of life (QoL) of the mothers. Study design: In a prospective experimental study, the intervention group received 6-session teleyoga for mother-preterm infant dyads (Tele-MiYo) and standard care, while the comparison group received outpatient standard care. Motor performance of the infants and anxiety, postpartum bonding, and QoL of the mothers were assessed before and after the study period. Results: Tele-MiYo group (n = 15) significantly improved in motor performance (p = 0.040). Mothers in the intervention group improved in terms of bonding (0.004), trait anxiety (p = 0.002), and QoL (p < 0.05). There was no difference in any outcome in the comparison group (n = 14; p > 0.05). Discussion: Tele-MiYo might improve the dyadic outcomes of mothers and preterm infants. This complementary and distant method might be considered especially when access to on-site healthcare is limited, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical trial registration: NCT05147480.

N2  - Background: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms in rural versus urban populations. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 24,227 cisgender women who gave birth from 2010 to 2021 at an academic medical center located in a rural midwestern state. Exclusion criteria were <18 years old, incarcerated, or without a documented zip code. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered during pregnancy and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during postpartum. A sub-cohort also completed a COVID-related questionnaire. Rurality was defined as living in a county with <50,000 people. The COVID-19 era was defined as 1/1/2020 to 9/25/2021. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used as appropriate. Significance was set at α < 0.05. Results: Rural participants were more likely (p ≤ 0.001) to exhibit clinical depression symptoms before the pandemic in both the prenatal (8.63 % of rural participants vs. 6.49 % of urban participants) and postpartum periods (11.19 % rural vs. 9.28 % urban). During the pandemic, urban participants had increased postpartum depression. Rural participants endorsed more financial and labor concerns, whereas urban participants expressed support system concerns. Limitations: Study data were gathered from participants who gave birth at a single, midwestern hospital. Results may not be widely generalizable given the homogeneity of participants. Conclusions: Rural women experienced higher rates of prenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms compared to their urban counterparts. The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant stressor, revealing specific mental health vulnerabilities among birthing people.

N2  - In India, adolescent girls are highly vulnerable, facing risks that hinder their healthy development into young women. India's Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (SABLA) aims to address these challenges by promoting health awareness and encouraging decision-making autonomy, fostering women's development. Using data from the nationally representative India Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) and exploiting exogenous variations in the program's rollout across districts and birth cohorts, we provide evidence that exposure to SABLA increases the likelihood of young female participants using family planning and modern family planning methods. Furthermore, it indicates that participants are more likely to adopt a healthier diet, characterized by increased consumption of green leafy vegetables and reduced intake of fried foods. Additionally, the program empowers participants to have control over their financial resources. The findings also reveal a significant reduction in the likelihood of anemia among women who were exposed to the program. Notably, our results suggest that SABLA contributes to delaying women's marriage and their first childbirth. We find that women exposed to the program have fewer children than their counterparts and face fewer pregnancy losses. To account for COVID-19 disruptions, we include a COVID dummy variable. While the pandemic affected family planning, nutrition, and anemia, SABLA's positive impact on health and empowerment remains strong. Notably, it did not affect women's role in household decision-making, highlighting its lasting effect on empowerment.

N2  - Objective: It remains unclear whether general hospitals without psychiatric wards can provide sufficient services for both physical and mental health needs, as they often lack adequate psychiatrists, primarily due to cost constraints. This article explores the relationship between the number of full-time psychiatrists and functionality for integrating physical and mental health services in these settings. Methods: The Medical Policy Committee of the Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry conducted a nationwide survey in 2022 to evaluate the detailed scope and volume of service of psychiatric departments in general hospitals without a psychiatric ward. The survey collected data related to scope and volume of service, including the availability of on-call services, the number of patients seen in outpatient settings, and the number of consultation-liaison services provided. The results were analyzed based on the number of full-time psychiatrists, with and without data from university hospitals, and categorized by hospital type. To account for confounding factors, multivariable regression analyses were also performed. Results: Broader scope and higher vollume in essential services was observed depending on the number of full-time psychiatrists, including on-call services, outpatient services, and consultation-liaison services, especially pediatric, anorexia, and perinatal psychiatric issues. Hospitals with multiple full-time psychiatrists offered broader services, a scope beyond the capacity of a single full-time psychiatrist, as confirmed by multivariable analyses. University hospitals offered the widest range of psychiatric services. Conclusions: Despite often being underestimated due to cost constraints, having multiple full-time psychiatrists in a general hospital without a psychiatric ward is essential for supporting the broader scope needed to integrate physical and mental health services.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic increased maternal depression and anxiety, imperiling both mothers' own wellbeing and that of their children. To date, however, little is known about the extent to which these increases are attributable to economic hardships commonly experienced during the pandemic: income loss, job loss, and loss of health insurance. Few studies have examined the individual impacts of these hardships, and none have lasted beyond the first year of the pandemic. This study harmonizes data from six evaluations of pediatric-based parenting programs for women with young children and low incomes across three U.S. cities (N = 1,254). Low-income mothers are of special interest because their families have been disproportionately affected by economic shocks due to COVID-19, and mothers of young children have been more distressed than other mothers by COVID-19. The studies’ combined window of observation lasted from the onset of the pandemic to over three years later. Results indicate that income loss, job loss, and health insurance loss were all significantly associated with depression and anxiety. When each hardship was assessed net of the others, lost income was associated with more than a two-fold increase in the odds of anxiety, and a lost job and lost health insurance were associated with 50% and 90% greater odds of depression, respectively. Associations between hardships and maternal mental health did not diminish over time during the window of observation. These associations are likely to have been even greater in the absence of generous social policies enacted during the pandemic.

N2  - Background: The attachment between father and infant is essential to a child’s later development and well-being; yet, hardly any research has examined father-to-infant attachment during the outbreak of COVID-19. This study, therefore, aims to examine psychological, interpersonal, and health-related factors associated with father-to-infant attachment at 3–12 months postpartum during the pandemic. Method: An online cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2021. A total of 775 fathers with at least one child aged 3–12 months were recruited. Participants completed measures of depression, COVID-19-related distress, relationship satisfaction, social support and other health-related factors including COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalisation. Data on psycho-socio-demographic, obstetric, and COVID-19-related characteristics were also collected. Results: Findings demonstrated that paternal depression (β = -.33, p <.001); relationship satisfaction (β =.19, p <.001); COVID-19-related psychological distress (β = -.14, p <.001) and social support (β =.13, p <.001) had a significant effect on father-to-infant attachment. Fathers who were multiparous, had COVID-19 diagnosis, and hospitalised due to COVID-19 were more likely to report poorer father-to-infant attachment. Paternal depression was the most influential factor on father-to-infant attachment, which attenuated the strength of the relationships between marital status, prematurity, history of trauma, sleep quality, and father-to-infant attachment once included into the analyses. No significant associations between educational level, employment, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, and father-to-infant attachment were observed. Conclusion: These findings highlight the critical role of paternal psychological well-being in establishing healthy father-to-infant attachment and the relevance of having satisfied interpersonal relationships in promoting this early relationship particularly during crises such as COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - During any crisis, whether it is health, economic, or environmental, people are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and other psychological issues that jeopardize their general well-being. The Coronavirus, or COVID-19, is considered a global pandemic that affects millions of persons. Many people of different ages have significantly suffered from mental illness as a result of COVID-19, especially women affected vulnerable. As per the report, the death rates of men have doubled in comparison with women; this epidemic shows a bigger influence on the health of women than men. Even quarantine impacts make the females afraid, bewildered, and feel alone, which is terrible for them, as it also disturbs their health, such as pregnancy, sexual life, postpartum depression, etc. This review article reveals the COVID-19 impact on the health of women and finds a way to prevent and manage the health implications in women at various periods throughout their lives.

N2  - Systematic crises may disrupt well-designed nutrition interventions. Continuing services requires understanding the intervention paths that have been disrupted and adapting as crises permit. Alive & Thrive developed an intervention to integrate nutrition services into urban antenatal care services in Dhaka, which started at the onset of COVID-19 and encountered extraordinary disruption of services. We investigated the disruptions and adaptations that occurred to continue the delivery of services for women and children and elucidated how the intervention team made those adaptations. We examined the intervention components planned and those implemented annotating the disruptions and adaptations. Subsequently, we detailed the intervention paths (capacity building, supportive supervision, demand generation, counselling services, and reporting, data management and performance review). We sorted out processes at the system, organizational, service delivery and individual levels on how the intervention team made the adaptations. Disruptions included decreased client load and demand for services, attrition of providers and intervention staff, key intervention activities becoming unfeasible and clients and providers facing challenges affecting utilization and provision of services. Adaptations included incorporating new guidance for the continuity of services, managing workforce turnover and incorporating remote modalities for all intervention components. The intervention adapted to continue by incorporating hybrid modalities including both original activities that were feasible and adapted activities. Amidst health system crises, the adapted intervention was successfully delivered. This knowledge of how to identify disruptions and adapt interventions during major crises is critical as Bangladesh and other countries face new threats (conflict, climate, economic downturns, inequities and epidemics).

N2  - Health governance during pregnancy is grounded in cultural norms about good mothering, which centre around self-sacrifice and perceived conflicts between maternal and fetal bodies. Nonetheless, many health choices in pregnancy should have mutual benefits and risks for maternal and fetal bodies, including vaccination during pregnancy. This manuscript presents results from a discourse analysis of 440 texts about vaccines that are recommended in pregnancy in Canada, including inactivated influenza, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular-pertussis, and COVID-19 vaccines. Texts include publicly available online information (e.g., webpages, printouts, posters, videos, and other materials) developed by various authoritative institutions (e.g., public health services, professional organizations, vaccine manufacturers). This study contributes to feminist and risk theorist critiques of public health discourse by exploring how texts deploy emotionally laden technical discourses that govern pregnant individuals towards divergent goals. Specifically, they are governed towards socially desirable health decisions (e.g., vaccination acceptance) and towards agonizing over decision-making as “good mothers.” I analyze how texts pursue this divergent governance in three ways, by deploying discourses that reify conflict between maternal and fetal bodies, organizing the work of making choices around gendered power relations, and activating emotions around mothering responsibilities. My analysis compares how such governance differs across products by available evidence and by the intended purpose of vaccination to protect maternal and/or fetal bodies. I conclude by discussing the value of combining governmentality and cultural approaches to risk theory to understand how the interface of public health and mothering discourses reproduce power relations, and suggest recommendations on how to lessen that reproduction.

N2  - Problem: It is unknown whether the deployment of registered nurses to assist midwives in the provision of postnatal care eases the burden of workforce shortages. Background: The largest public maternity health service in Western Australia began employing registered nurses in 2022 to assist midwives with the provision of postnatal care on maternity wards in response to staffing shortages, exacerbated by COVID-19. Aim: To explore midwives’ and registered nurses’ experiences of providing postnatal care on maternity wards together. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a paper-based survey tool. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data. Results: 70 staff participated (n= 58 midwives, n=12 nurses). Only 19.2 % of participants felt positively about their workload allocation. Most participants (62.7 %) reported a usual allocation of 6–7 mother-baby dyads to care for. Significantly more midwives preferred allocation by the shift coordinator than nurses; and significantly more nurses preferred ‘team nursing’ than midwives. Discussion: Strategic approaches are needed to improve recruitment and retention of midwifery workforce capable of responding to periods of acute demands across the full scope of midwifery practice. Guidance concerning nurses’ scope of practice in the postnatal setting is necessary from a professional, medico-legal, governance and safety standpoint. Conclusion: The deployment of registered nurses into postnatal wards may be of some benefit to midwives in the context of workforce shortages. Parameters must be set outlining what is within nurses’ scope of practice in the postnatal care setting.

N2  - AIMS: To describe the process of breastfeeding relationships among stay-at-home mother and infant dyads at 1, 3, 5 and 6 months. DESIGN: A longitudinal qualitative online survey design was used. METHODS: Data were obtained at 1, 3, 5 and 6 months from 26 breastfeeding mothers who stayed home with their infants and directly breastfed at least once a day for the first 6 months between June 2022 and August 2023. Mothers' written responses to 3 open-ended questions were analysed to assess breastfeeding experiences at home, thoughts/comments while directly breastfeeding and breastfeeding concerns/problems and strategies they used. Based on grounded theory, inductive content analysis was used to analyse the data. Trustworthiness of results was established by coding to consensus, formal peer debriefing and maintaining an audit trail. RESULTS: 'Breastfeeding Relationships at Home,' the core construct, was identified and organized the process of breastfeeding relationships into 5 domains: (1) mothers' emotional well-being while breastfeeding, (2) infant-led feeding, (3) alternatives to breastfeeding, (4) evaluation of breastfeeding and (5) changes in breastfeeding as infants grow older. CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding is not simply about feeding breast milk but also involves nurturing and developing a relationship between mother and infant. Across the domains, mutual responsiveness, a central element of the breastfeeding relationship was clear. Mothers who were committed to breastfeeding with embedded infant suckling reached emotional well-being in return for their engagement which has potential to reduce maternal stress and prevent postpartum depression. IMPACT: Findings from the current study add to nurses' knowledge about the relationship building process between stay-at-home mothers and their infants in the first 6 months of breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses must remain sensitive to aid the development of breastfeeding relationships in the home environment to maximize mutual responsiveness. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patients or public involved.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to investigate the current landscape of evidence-based mHealth resources designed to support pregnant patients with fetal anomalies, with a focus on enhancing maternal wellbeing, disseminating relevant information, and facilitating communication with nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals. STUDY DESIGN: Using the JBI (formerly known as the Joanna Briggs Institute) scoping review protocol and the PRISMA-ScR framework, we conducted a comprehensive search across databases including CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. METHODS: A keyword search was conducted, resulting in 227 unique records. Articles discussing mobile apps for pregnancies with a fetal diagnosis or fetal risk for anomaly were included, including hospital-affiliated or telehealth apps that were adapted for use with this specific population. RESULTS: Ten articles were selected for inclusion. Our analysis identified several predominant themes. The surge of mHealth, influenced in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, has provided critical access to care for pregnant patients with fetal anomalies through mobile platforms. Comprehensive resource tools integrating informational components via mHealth are needed to offer flexibility to patients as well as nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals. Adopting a patient-driven approach in developing mHealth resources is important in meeting the needs of patients, their families, and their health care team. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A framework for the development and implementation of high-fidelity mHealth resources tailored to this vulnerable population is needed. Emphasizing a patient-centered approach in the creation of mHealth resources is paramount to ensuring their effectiveness and usefulness for pregnant women experiencing fetal anomalies, their families, and the perinatal health care team.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health systems are resilient if they absorb, adapt, and transform in response to shocks. Although absorptive and adaptive capacities have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 response, little has been documented about their transformability and strengthened service delivery systems. We aimed to describe improvements in maternal and child health service delivery as a result of investments during the COVID-19 response. METHODS: This was a descriptive case study conducted in Wakiso District in central Uganda. It included 21 nurses and midwives as key informants and 32 mothers in three focus group discussions. Data were collected using an interview guide following the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety theoretical framework for service delivery. RESULTS: Maternal and child health service delivery during the pandemic involved service provision without changes, service delivery with temporary changes and outcomes, and service delivery that resulted into sustained changes and outcomes. Temporary changes included patient schedule adjustments, community service delivery and negative outcomes such as increased workload and stigma against health workers. Sustained changes that strengthened service delivery included new infrastructure and supplies such as ambulances and equipment, new roles involving infection prevention and control, increased role of community health workers and outcomes such as improved workplace safety and teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on health systems, it created the impetus to invest in system improvements. Investments such as new facility infrastructure and emergency medical services were leveraged to improve maternal and child health services delivery. The inter-departmental collaboration during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted into an improved intra-hospital environment for other service delivery. However, there is a need to evaluate lessons beyond health facilities and whether these learnings are deliberately integrated into service delivery. Future responses should also address the psychological and physical impacts suffered by health workers to maintain service delivery.

N2  - Background: While countries' coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency contingency and response plans aimed to prevent and control the spread of the virus, they also caused major disruptions to health services. We assessed the effects of COVID-19 on coverage and inequalities in select maternal, newborn, and child health services in Burkina Faso. Methods: We analysed data from two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in two provinces, one rural and one urban. The first survey of 3375 households was conducted immediately before the pandemic (February to March 2020) and the second survey in the same areas two years after the pandemic (May to June 2022) using a similar methodology. We compared the coverage of maternal, newborn, and child health interventions and care-seeking between the two surveys to assess the effects of the pandemic on maternal, newborn, and child health services. Results: Our findings did not show significant disruptions in coverage of antenatal service, postnatal care for mothers and babies, child routine vaccination, and care-seeking for sick children during the pandemic. However, there was a dramatic drop of the number of women (23 percentage points) accompanied by their partners for delivery as well as the number of caesarean-section deliveries in urban areas. The shortage of health staff, facility congestion, fear of getting COVID-19 after a caesarean-section admission, and prioritisation of critical health services such as emergency caesarean-section to the detriment of elective cases may explain the decline of caesarean-section rates. Conclusions: COVID-19 did not cause major reversals in the coverage of maternal, newborn, and child health services in Burkina Faso, except for caesarean sections. We also saw no substantial increases in service coverage. In the absence of a counterfactual, we could not attribute the stagnation to the pandemic. However, the very low proportion of women reporting disruption in care-seeking suggests some resilience of the health systems to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This survey of rural nurses' experiences is part of a program evaluation of the Rural Surgical and Obstetrical Networks (RSON), a five-year initiative (2018-2023) to strengthen and stabilize rural hospitals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. PURPOSE: Our aim was to measure changes in professional and work-related quality-of-life of rural surgical and obstetrical nurses in eight communities across BC and determine if the RSON initiative mitigated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' quality of life. METHODS: This longitudinal evaluation was administered via online surveys in 2021 and 2023. Work-related quality of life was measured with 23 items that assess job satisfaction, general wellbeing, work-life balance, stress level experienced at work, control, and working conditions. Professional quality of life was measured along three dimensions: compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout, and secondary traumatic stress (STS) (10 items each). Responses were linked by code and changes in quality of life were analyzed using paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: 107 nurses participated at time 1 and 28 at time 2. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress scores at time 1 were lower among older nurses and those with children. Over the two-year period (2021 to 2023), significant increases were observed in burnout (p < 0.001), and secondary traumatic stress (p = 0.04), while work-related Quality-of-Life decreased significantly (p = 0.04). Compassion satisfaction decreased over time, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: While the RSON initiative could not mitigate decreases in professional and work-related quality-of-life during COVID-19, it offered opportunities for clinical education and professional development among rural nurses.

N2  - Engaging adolescents and young people as partners in research is increasingly acknowledged as a vital strategy to ensure diverse voices are heard and to catalyze social change. This article, coauthored by adolescent and adult researchers, presents the methodological approach and outcomes of a youth-led participatory action research (YPAR) study in which three teams of youth researchers developed and implemented projects examining equity-related factors affecting adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights (ASRHR) in Ontario, Canada. Teams of four assigned-female youth researchers aged 16-19 years were recruited from three priority regions through purposive sampling. Selected youth completed a paid 5-day virtual YPAR training. Each youth team, supported by adult research mentors, identified key ASRHR issues in their region and developed a related research question. Each team then determined their study's design, obtained institutional ethics approval, and conducted data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Based on their findings, teams proposed potential solutions and communicated results to multiple stakeholders. Methodologically, the YPAR process amplified youth voices through a social justice-framed approach to examining ASRHR. Centering the perspectives, values, and experiences of youth positively impacted the youth researchers themselves, while yielding results that were relevant, meaningful, adolescent-responsive, and culturally informed. Results from the youth-led projects identified multiple barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health services and products. Policy and practice implications encompassed concerns related to geographical accessibility, equity, service provider competence, and content of sexuality education curricula.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Most surveys examining health professionals' knowledge, attitudes and practices around abortion have used convenience samples and have targeted doctors. Our goal in the SACHA Study, drawing on evidence-based strategies to maximise response rates, was to achieve a representative sample of a wider range of health professionals, working in general practice, maternity services, pharmacies, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinics and specialist abortion services in Britain, to explore the knowledge, attitudes and experience of abortion care and views on future models of delivery. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of midwives, doctors, nurses and pharmacists in England, Scotland and Wales was undertaken between November, 2021 and July, 2022. We used a stratified cluster sampling approach to select a random sample of sites and all eligible staff within those services were asked to respond to the survey. Evidence-based strategies to maximise completion rates were adopted, including postal delivery of the one-page questionnaire with personal letter of invitation and a stamped address envelope for return, inclusion of an unconditional voucher and follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 147 of the 314 (46.8%) health service sites randomly selected took part in the survey. Reasons for non-participation included local Research and Development (R&D) Department non-response, lack of resources or insufficient time to support or approve the study, lack of interest in or perceived relevance of the topic and insufficient capacity to take part, exacerbated by work demands during the COVID epidemic. Of the 1370 questionnaires sent to eligible identified participants within these services, 771 were completed and returned (56.3%). At the service level the highest proportion of returns was from SRH clinics (81.0%) and the lowest from general practice (32.4%). In relation to profession, returns were highest amongst midwives (69.6%) and lowest amongst pharmacists (36.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining information about health professional knowledge, attitudes and practices is key to guide service development and policy and to identify gaps in training and service provision in abortion. Despite our attempts to gain a representative sample of health professionals, the challenges we experienced limited the representativeness of the sample, despite the use of an evidence-based strategy.

N2  - Beginning in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic limited onsite international activities and challenged us to plan and implement new ways of collaboration. We reviewed our online trials during a three-year period to better understand how to use digital technologies to continue knowledge and skills transfer. In this cross-national case study, we compare two illustrative cases: Japanese experts training Indonesian health professionals for participatory school health education, and Swiss experts training Malagasy health providers for respectful obstetric and newborn emergencies. We first describe our cases, referring to Vargo's framework for summarizing reports on digital technology usage. Second, we draw commonalities between the two cases. Third, gleaned from these experiences during the pandemic, we offer a practical framework for efficient and effective international collaboration using new technologies. For both cases, basic digital technologies, such as online meetings and e-mailing, were used and training sessions were successfully conducted. Trusting relationships between the training and participant groups were in place before the pandemic. This led to enthusiasm for continuing learning even after the pandemic started. Our case comparison presents the usefulness of digital technologies for continuing international collaboration and highlights the importance of human factors, such as trusting relationships and enthusiasm to pursue a shared goal, as the basic condition for success.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine maternal characteristics associated with perceived unmet mental health needs and mental health care settings, focusing on residential rurality and race/ethnicity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed self-reported unmet mental health needs and mental health care settings among 1097 pregnant respondents in the 2020-2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, incorporating the complex sampling weights for national representativeness. FINDINGS: Non-Hispanic Black pregnant individuals and those living in nonmetro rural areas reported lower odds of unmet mental health needs compared to those in large metro areas and non-Hispanic White individuals. Pregnant individuals in nonmetro rural areas and non-Hispanic other pregnant individuals also reported lower odds of utilizing virtual mental care services, while non-Hispanic other pregnant individuals were less likely to receive prescription medication than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in mental health care access by rurality and race/ethnicity reveal increased barriers for nonmetro rural and minority pregnant populations, particularly regarding virtual and prescription-based care. The lower unmet health needs among Black pregnant individuals and those living in nonmetro rural areas may reflect adjusted expectations or reliance on informal support systems, emphasizing the need to understand these perceptions. COVID-19's impact on access patterns further highlights the need for more research on barriers to maternal mental health treatment. Tailored mental health interventions and policy reforms are needed to enhance accessible, culturally sensitive maternal mental health services across diverse communities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Childbirth and parenting education (CBPE) programs provide participants with information about pregnancy and labour and have a multitude of positive health impacts. During COVID-19, many CBPE classes ceased or transitioned to an online format, significantly impacting pregnant women across Australia. Little is known about the provision and delivery of CBPE in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of CBPE educators and hospital managers, regarding its impact on staff and implications for ongoing service delivery. METHODS: The PACS study was an online survey distributed through CBPE networks across Australia, including via Childbirth and Parenting Educators of Australia (CAPEA) and the NSW Parenting, Birth and Early Parenting Education Coordinators Network. RESULTS: From the 67 responses received, there was a substantial shift toward online delivery, however, there was an overall decrease in the number of classes provided. Respondents reported that CBPE was not prioritised by management during the pandemic, citing increased workloads, and a lack of access to equipment, infrastructure and support. Educators adapted over time, however, the loss of social connection and participant engagement was the main barrier to service delivery and raises concerns regarding ongoing services. CONCLUSION: Health systems should ensure there is adequate technological infrastructure, equipment, consultation and support for CBPE to make a positive transition to online and hybrid services and for future proofing delivery. It is essential that greater prioritisation and investment in educator staffing, consultation and training is provided, as well as further research into improving the quality of classes for continued delivery of high-quality education.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The specific aims of the project are: (1) Examine the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy experiences and outcomes; (2) Examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 in pregnant women and mothers of children 12 months or younger; (3) Identify risk and protective factors among this population in Puerto Rico. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Puerto Rico Team for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Superfund Program, which is composed of pregnant women and mothers from the northern karst region of Puerto Rico. The research had a mixed methods approach with a quantitative survey (n = 184) and qualitative interviews (n = 10); data collection was done in virtual mode. RESULTS: Findings from the qualitative interviews highlight the experiences regarding access to healthcare services, pregnancy and birth experiences, social support, and mental health during the pandemic among women with young children. These narratives serve to illustrate the particular challenges and opportunities that the participants faced during the year 2021 in regard to maternal health in Puerto Rico. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: COVID-19 restrictions impacted the experiences in receiving healthcare services, particularly regarding the birthing process and the participants' mental health. Social support, particularly from family, was found to be a protective factor for facing the challenges during pandemic times. We expect that the findings can lead to the development of interventions for community health centers, prenatal clinics, non-governmental organizations, and parents/caretakers in Puerto Rico.

N2  - Fetal death is defined as the spontaneous cessation of cardiac activity after 14 weeks gestational age (GA). Regarding prevention of fetal death in the general population, it is not recommended to counsel or prescribe rest, aspirin, vitamin A, vitamin D, or micronutrient supplementation; systematically look for nuchal cord during prenatal screening ultrasound; or perform systematic antepartum monitoring by cardiotocography for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of fetal death. It is recommended to offer vaccination against influenza in epidemic periods and against SARS-CoV-2. Regarding evaluation in the event of fetal death, it is recommended that a fetal autopsy and anatomopathologic examination of the placenta be performed; chromosomal analysis be performed by microarray testing, rather than by conventional karyotype (with postnatal sampling of the fetal placental surface preferred for genetic purposes); testing for antiphospholipid antibodies be performed, with systematic Kleihauer-Betke testing and for irregular agglutinins; and summary consultation to discuss these examination results be offered. Regarding announcement and support, it is recommended that fetal death be announced without ambiguity, using simple words adapted to each situation, after which the couple should be supported with empathy across the different stages of their care. Regarding patient management in cases of fetal death, it is recommended that: in the absence of risks for disseminated intravascular coagulation or maternal demise, the patient's wishes regarding the timing between the fetal death diagnosis and labor induction should be considered; return home is possible, according to the patient's wishes; in all situations except maternal life-threatening emergencies, the preferred mode of delivery is vaginal, regardless of previous cesarean section(s); mifepristone 200 mg be prescribed at least 24 h before induction; and perimedullary analgesia be initiated at the start of induction if requested by the patient, regardless of GA. Of note, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either the administration route (i.e., vaginal or oral) of misoprostol or prostaglandin type. Regarding the risk of recurrence after unexplained fetal death: the incidence does not appear to be increased in subsequent pregnancies; in cases with a history of fetal death due to vascular problems, low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce perinatal morbidity (otherwise, evidence is insufficient to recommend the prescription of aspirin); no optimal delay in initiating another pregnancy should be recommended based solely on a history of fetal death; fetal heart rate monitoring is not indicated based solely on a history of fetal death; although systematic labor induction is not recommended, induction may be considered depending on the context and parental request, and considering fetal age, benefits, and risks, especially before 39 weeks GA. Note that if the cause of fetal death is identified, management should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Regarding fetal death in a twin pregnancy, it is recommended that the surviving twin be examined immediately upon fetal death diagnosis; in a dichorionic twin pregnancy, preterm delivery induction is not recommended; in a monochorionic twin pregnancy, the surviving twin should be immediately evaluated for signs of acute fetal anemia, with weekly ultrasound monitoring for the first month, though immediate labor induction is not recommended.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Adverse situations can affect the mental health and support of pregnant women and their partners, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting confinement periods. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the protective factors in the mental health of pregnant women and their partners, as well as the interrelationships of these factors, in an adverse situation, through the assessment of resilience, perceived support, anxiety, depression and stress. METHODS: The sample consisted of 38 women with no pregnancy risk and 25 partners evaluated between gestation weeks 24 and 31. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study. RESULTS: The pregnant women presented lower resilience, greater social support (especially family support), and greater intensity of depression, anxiety and stress than their partners. Moreover, a mutual relationship was found, both in depression and general support, between the members of the couple. CONCLUSION: During the confinement, pregnant women have presented greater vulnerability in mental health, despite perceiving greater social support than their partners. Greater resilience in the partners could be a relevant factor to cope with situation of adversity during pregnancy, as indicated by the relationship detected between the risk and protective factors. It would be desirable to improve the attention and care of pregnant women during prolonged periods of adversity, including the couple, and to strengthen mutual support.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the direct and indirect influences of COVID-19-related restrictions on adolescents and young people's (AYP's) sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with a focus on teenage pregnancy and access to and utilization of HIV testing and counselling services. METHODS: Thirty-four purposively sampled interviews that comprised of selected representatives of organizations involved in activities aimed at addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights (ASRHR), teenage pregnancies, and HIV testing were conducted in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In Zambia, the study conducted an additional four group discussions with adolescents and young people. Adolescents and young people were asked to describe their experience and perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their SRHR. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Priority shifts resulted in the focus of service provision to the COVID-19 response. This led to shortages of already insufficient human resources due to infection and/or isolation, supply chain disruptions leading to shortages of important sexual and reproductive health (SRH)-related commodities and supplies, compromised quality of services such as counselling for HIV and overall limited AYP's access to SRH information. Suggestions for interventions to improve SRH services include the need for a disaster preparedness strategy, increased funding for ASRHR, the use of community health workers and community-based ASRHR strategies, and the use of technology and social media platforms such as mHealth. CONCLUSION: Disruption of SRH services for adolescents and young people due to pandemic related-restrictions, and diversion of resources/funding has had a ripple effect that may have long-term consequences for adolescents and young people throughout the East and Southern African region. This calls for further investment in adolescents and young people's access to SRHR services as progress made may have been deterred.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite that globally the percent of women and men who tested positive for COVID-19 appears equal and that men with COVID-19 were 60% more likely than women to be severely ill and to die from complications (Rozenberg et al., 2020), studies of sex differences show that women compared with men are more likely to manifest persistent post-COVID-19 syndrome (PPCS). PURPOSE: In this paper, we address some of the extant evidence for impact of the PPCS on women's health and well-being to underpin our suggestions for research and policy considerations. METHODS: We assessed key papers in the extant literature to formulate views on needed health-related research and policies. DISCUSSION: We discuss how key PPCS manifestations vary by sex, resemble sequelae uncovered for other chronically fatiguing or serious postinfectious trauma conditions, influence women's reproductive health (e.g., menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause transition), impair women's social function and economic productivity, and challenge what is required for influential treatment and prevention. CONCLUSION: To inform effective diagnosis, management and prevention of the significantly prevalent and debilitating PPCS, high on research and policy agendas should be uncovering multidimensional evidence of the impact on women, especially on their overall and reproductive health, well-being, social function and economic productivity.

N2  - Background: There are several identified service user and provider barriers which lead to missed vaccination opportunities for adults within primary care. Programs delivering vaccination in non-primary care settings, such as in emergency departments, hospitals, specialist clinic and non-medical settings may assist in filling these gaps, especially among under-served populations. While expanding the locations in which vaccines are provided may improve uptake, there is a need to explore service user and provider attitudes towards delivery. Objectives: This scoping review aims to explore perceptions and attitudes of adult service users and providers towards receiving and delivering vaccination in non-primary care settings and identify how attitudes relate to determinants of vaccine compliance. Methods: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies that focused on attitudes and perceptions of adult service users and providers towards the delivery of influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal, and herpes zoster vaccines in non-primary care settings were included. Primary, peer-reviewed studies published in English from 01/01/2010 to 31/12/2023 were sought. Studies that focused on vaccination in primary care settings, the operational delivery of vaccination programs and interventions, children or adolescents less than 18 years, pregnant women, and healthcare workers receiving vaccination for occupational purposes were excluded. Results: 30 studies were included for final analysis in this study. 22 were cross-sectional studies, and 19 were published in the United States. 15 studies were conducted in non-medical settings and 11 in the emergency department. Findings showed that service users were receptive towards vaccination in non-primary care settings and were especially motivated by the convenience of non-medical settings such as workplaces, mobile clinics, drive through clinics, and faith-based organisations. A number of service user barriers were reported to vaccine acceptance, including low confidence in vaccines, fear of adverse effects, and low risk perception of infection. Findings of the included studies highlight a number of provider attitudinal barriers to the delivery of vaccinations outside of primary care, such as considering the process too time-consuming, costly, and detracting from the purpose of their work, although the number of studies assessing provider attitudes were limited. Conclusion: Overall, there is a limited amount of evidence available regarding the attitudes to vaccination in non-primary care settings, especially among providers. There is a need for more study in this area to strengthen understanding of attitudes towards vaccination delivery in these settings. Mapping of available studies suggests there is a high acceptance level among service users towards vaccination in non-primary care settings, especially those in non-medical settings who lack routine access to the healthcare system. Further exploration of this and expansion of programs may serve to improve vaccine access and assist in overcoming inequity.

N2  - An increasing number of children with complex life-limiting and life-threatening conditions are being cared for at home by their parents. Negative impacts on maternal health are now being recognised. This study sought to voice parental experiences to determine what matters most; explore day-to-day decision making and Advance Care Planning; and to inform local service development. Seven mothers from one community nursing service were interviewed using a semi-structured qualitative approach during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Seven data-driven themes were identified following six phase thematic analysis: cherishing normality; navigating the system; being proactive; meaningful connections; beginner to expert – and back; they’re not any child – they’re my child; and Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Practice implications include early discussion of what matters most and benefits of written plans to ensure fair access to treatment for children with complex health. Mothers highlighted that sharing their story enhanced their sense of coping and purpose. Increased support at times of vulnerability and permission to explore decisions were highly valued.

N2  - Objective: This study compared the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of parenteral iron, using intravenous iron sucrose (IVIS) therapy against the standard regimen of oral iron (OI) therapy for managing iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) among pregnant women in a natural primary care setting in Gujarat. Design: A prospective cost-effectiveness study was conducted in natural programme setting wherein 188 pregnant women in their 14 to 18 weeks with moderate and severe anemia women enrolled from two districts of Gujarat, and 142 were followed up until the post-partum phase. The intervention group comprised of 82 participants who were administered IVIS, while the comparison group comprised of 106 participants who were put on OI therapy. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were measured at periodic intervals, first during enrollment and then during each month of pregnancy period and finally on the 42nd day of the post-natal period. Outcome measures: Change in mean Hb level from baseline was the primary outcome, while the incidence of morbidity and mortality was a secondary outcome measure. Results: The intervention group showed a significant incremental mean change in Hb level from 8.2 g/dl to 11.45 g/dl at the fourth follow-up, while the control group's mean Hb level reduced from 9.99 g/dl to 9.55 g/dl. The discounted cost per beneficiary for IVIS was US$ 87, while that for OI was US$ 49. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$ 9.84, which is 0.049% of India's per capita GDP. Conclusion: IVIS therapy was more clinically effective and cost-effective than OI therapy among pregnant women for management of moderate and severe anemia.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has globally impacted health service access, delivery and resources. There are limited data regarding the impact on the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service delivery in low-resource settings. Neotree (www.neotree.org) combines data collection, clinical decision support and education to improve care for neonates. Here we evaluate impacts of COVID-19 on care for HIV-exposed neonates. Methods: Data on HIV-exposed neonates admitted to the neonatal unit (NNU) at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, between 01/06/2019 and 31/12/2021 were analysed, with pandemic start defined as 21/03/2020 and periods of industrial action (doctors (September 2019-January 2020) and nurses (June 2020-September 2020)) included, resulting in modelling during six time periods: pre-doctors’ strike (baseline); doctors’ strike; post-doctors’ strike and pre-COVID; COVID and pre-nurses’ strike; nurses’ strike; post nurses’ strike. Interrupted time series models were used to explore changes in indicators over time. Results: Of 8,333 neonates admitted to the NNU, 904 (11%) were HIV-exposed. Mothers of 706/765 (92%) HIV-exposed neonates reported receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy. Compared to the baseline period when average admissions were 78 per week (95% confidence interval (CI) 70–87), significantly fewer neonates were admitted during all subsequent periods until after the nurses’ strike, with the lowest average number during the nurses’ strike (28, 95% CI 23–34, p < 0.001). Across all time periods excluding the nurses strike, average mortality was 20% (95% CI 18–21), but rose to 34% (95% CI 25, 46) during the nurses’ strike. There was no evidence for heterogeneity (p > 0.22) in numbers of admissions or mortality by HIV exposure status. Fewer HIV-exposed neonates received a PCR test during the pandemic (23%) compared to the pre-pandemic periods (40%) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41–0.84, p < 0.001). The proportion of HIV-exposed neonates who received antiretroviral prophylaxis during admission was high throughout, averaging between 84% and 95% in each time-period. Conclusion: While antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-exposed neonates remained high throughout, concerning data on low admissions and increased mortality, similar in HIV-exposed and unexposed neonates, and reduced HIV testing, suggest some aspects of care may have been compromised due to indirect effects of the pandemic.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with widespread social disruptions, as governments implemented lockdowns to quell disease spread. To advance knowledge of consequences for households in resource-limited countries, we examine food insecurity during the pandemic period. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study and used logistic regression to examine factors associated with food insecurity. Data were collected between August and September of 2021 through a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) using a survey instrument focused on knowledge regarding the spread of COVID-19; food availability; COVID-19 related shocks/coping; under-five child healthcare services; and healthcare services for pregnant women. The study is set in two communities in Eastern Ethiopia, one rural (Kersa) and one urban (Harar), and included a random sample of 880 households. Results: Roughly 16% of households reported not having enough food to eat during the pandemic, an increase of 6% since before the pandemic. After adjusting for other variables, households were more likely to report food insecurity if they were living in an urban area, were a larger household, had a family member lose employment, reported an increase in food prices, or were food insecure before the pandemic. Households were less likely to report food insecurity if they were wealthier or had higher household income. Conclusions: After taking individual and household level sociodemographic characteristics into consideration, households in urban areas were at higher risk for food insecurity. These findings suggest a need for expanding food assistance programs to more urban areas to help mitigate the impact of lockdowns on more vulnerable households.

N2  - Background: Persons with opioid use disorders who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States (US) face multiple and intertwining health risks. These include interference with consistent access, linkage, and retention to health care including medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), HIV prevention using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Most services, when available, including those that address substance misuse, HIV prevention, and STIs, are often provided in multiple locations that may be difficult to access, which further challenges sustained health for PWID. HPTN 094 (INTEGRA) is a study designed to test the efficacy of an integrated, “whole-person” strategy that provides integrated HIV prevention including antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, MOUD, and STI testing and treatment from a mobile health delivery unit (“mobile unit”) with peer navigation compared to peer navigation alone to access these services at brick and mortar locations. Methods: HPTN 094 (INTEGRA) is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial in 5 US cities where approximately 400 PWID without HIV are assigned either to an experimental condition that delivers 26 weeks of “one-stop” integrated health services combined with peer navigation and delivered in a mobile unit or to an active control condition using peer navigation only for 26 weeks to the same set of services delivered in community settings. The primary outcomes include being alive and retained in MOUD and PrEP at 26 weeks post-randomization. Secondary outcomes measure the durability of intervention effects at 52 weeks following randomization. Discussion: This trial responds to a need for evidence on using a “whole-person” strategy for delivering integrated HIV prevention and substance use treatment, while testing the use of a mobile unit that meets out-of-treatment PWID wherever they might be and links them to care systems and/or harm reduction services. Findings will be important in guiding policy for engaging PWID in HIV prevention or care, substance use treatment, and STI testing and treatment by addressing the intertwined epidemics of addiction and HIV among those who have many physical and geographic barriers to access care. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04804072. Registered on 18 March 2021.

N2  - Background: The anxiety and their related disorders (AD) are the most common of all mental health conditions, and affect approximately 20% of pregnant and postpartum people. They are associated with significant distress and life interference for sufferers, as well as negative consequences for fetal and infant development. At present, little if any routine screening for prenatal AD is being conducted and data regarding the most effective tools to screen for these disorders is lacking. The majority of screening studies suffer from methodological difficulties which undermine the confidence needed to recommend measures for population distribution. The primary purpose of this research is to identify the most accurate self-report tool(s) to screen for perinatal AD. Methods: A large, prospective cohort of pregnant people (N = 1,000) is being recruited proportionally across health service delivery regions in British Columbia (BC). The screening accuracy of a broad range of perinatal AD self-report measures are being assessed using gold standard methodology. Consenting individuals are administered online questionnaires followed by a semi-structured diagnostic interview between 16- and 36-weeks’ gestation, and again between 6 and 20 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires include all screening measures, measures of sleep and unpaid family work, and questions pertaining to demographic and reproductive history, COVID-19, gender role burden, and mental health treatment utilization. Interviews assess all current anxiety disorders, as well as obsessive–compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Discussion: This research is in response to an urgent demand for accurate perinatal AD screening tools based on high quality evidence. AD among perinatal people often go unidentified and untreated, resulting in continued suffering and life impairment. Findings from this research will inform healthcare providers, policymakers, and scientists, about the most effective approach to screening for anxiety and related disorders in pregnancy in the postpartum period.

N2  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts physical health, mental health, and healthcare use. IPV during pregnancy, in particular, is associated with lower rates of antenatal care, but no studies have assessed the association between IPV and postpartum healthcare. This study aims to examine the link between IPV (emotional, physical, and sexual) and two outcomes: postpartum healthcare use and access to family planning. Methods: This study uses data from a cross-sectional survey of 859 women in Nairobi and Kiambu counties in Kenya who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Results: In this sample, 36% of women reported ever experiencing IPV. Of those, 33% indicated the frequency of IPV stayed the same or increased during COVID-19. Nearly 17% of women avoided postpartum healthcare and 10% experienced issues accessing family planning. Those who experienced any form of IPV during pregnancy had approximately twice the odds of avoiding postpartum healthcare compared to those who did not experience any form of IPV. Compared to those who did not experience IPV during pregnancy, experiencing sexual IPV was associated with 2.25 times higher odds of reporting issues accessing family planning. Additionally, reporting fair or poor self-rated health was associated with both avoiding postpartum healthcare and reporting issues accessing family planning. Experiencing food insecurity was also associated with avoiding postpartum healthcare. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the link between IPV during pregnancy and postpartum healthcare access. During COVID-19 in Kenya, postpartum women who had experienced IPV were at increased risk of disengagement with healthcare services. Women should be screened for IPV during pregnancy and postpartum in order to better support their healthcare needs. In times of crisis, such as pandemics, policymakers and healthcare providers must address barriers to healthcare for postpartum women.

N2  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections globally, with most RSV-related deaths occurring in infants < 6 months of age. The highest burden of RSV is in low-and-middle income countries, and in sub-Saharan Africa, RSV may be responsible for almost half of all hospital admissions with severe or very severe pneumonia among infants under 1 year. There is a maternal RSV vaccine on the horizon. Our study objective was to better understand how lessons learned from the COVID-19 vaccine experience rollout among pregnant and lactating people in Kenya could inform future maternal RSV vaccine rollout. Methods: This qualitative study interviewed 16 healthcare providers including doctors, nurses, midwives, community health workers, and vaccinators. Participants were recruited from two counties in Kenya and included healthcare providers that served diverse communities. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data. Results: As healthcare providers interviewed were instrumental in COVID-19 vaccine rollout among pregnant women in Kenya, they provided lessons learned from the COVID-19 vaccine experience to inform future maternal RSV vaccine rollout. Community sensitization emerged as the most critical lesson learned, including communication, mobilization, and education. Using communication to ensure community awareness of RSV, community awareness of RSV harms and benefits of RSV maternal vaccines, and providing up-to-date, clear information about maternal RSV vaccines emerged as lessons. Related to mobilization, participants identified the need for healthcare providers and community leaders to gain the trust of communities, and the importance of routinizing the vaccine. Finally, for education, participants outlined critical questions patients would have about a maternal RSV vaccine, including those related to vaccine safety concerns, duration of protection, and vaccine dosing. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies that has examined how lessons learned from the COVID-19 vaccine rollout for pregnant and lactating women can inform the rollout of future maternal vaccines, including an RSV maternal vaccine. As healthcare providers are directly involved in vaccine rollout, their perspectives are crucial for successful vaccine acceptance.

N2  - Background: Pregnant and postpartum women’s experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emotional and psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on perinatal health, has been well-documented across high-income countries. Increased anxiety and fear, isolation, as well as a disrupted pregnancy and postnatal period are widely described in many studies. The aim of this study was to explore, describe and synthesise studies that addressed the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women in high-income countries during the first two years of the pandemic. Methods: A qualitative evidence synthesis of studies relating to women’s experiences in high-income countries during the pandemic were included. Two reviewers extracted the data using a thematic synthesis approach and NVivo 20 software. The GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) was used to assess confidence in review findings. Results: Sixty-eight studies were eligible and subjected to a sampling framework to ensure data richness. In total, 36 sampled studies contributed to the development of themes, sub-themes and review findings. There were six over-arching themes: (1) dealing with public health restrictions; (2) navigating changing health policies; (3) adapting to alternative ways of receiving social support; (4) dealing with impacts on their own mental health; (5) managing the new and changing information; and (6) being resilient and optimistic. Seventeen review findings were developed under these themes with high to moderate confidence according to the GRADE-CERQual assessment. Conclusions: The findings from this synthesis offer different strategies for practice and policy makers to better support women, babies and their families in future emergency responses. These strategies include optimising care delivery, enhancing communication, and supporting social and mental wellbeing.

N2  - Background: Vaccination has been recommended as one of the approaches for the control of COVID-19 pandemic. However, adequate vaccine coverage is critical to the effectiveness of the vaccine at population level. Data on acceptability of the vaccine in Ugandan urban areas are limited. This study examined the prevalence, factors associated with willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine including reasons for not taking COVID-19 vaccine in a predominantly urban population of Wakiso, central Uganda. Methods: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study conducted between March 1st, 2021 and September 30th, 2021 in the urban population-based cohort of the Africa Medical and behavioral Sciences Organization (AMBSO). A Multivariable modified Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals of willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total of 1,903 participants were enrolled in this study; 61% of whom were females. About 63% of participants indicated their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Persons aged 13–19 years (aPR = 0.79; [95% CI: 0.74, 0.84]) or 20-29years (aPR = 0.93; [95% CI: 0.88, 0.98]) were less likely to accept the vaccine compared to persons aged 40–49 years. Persons with post-primary level of education (aPR = 1.05; [95% CI: 1.02, 1.09]) were more likely to accept the vaccine compared to persons with primary level of education. Additionally, students or individuals working in government (aPR = 1.13; [95% CI: 1.04, 1.23]) were more likely to accept the vaccine compared to individuals doing construction and Mechanic work as their main occupation. Reported reasons for not taking a COVID-19 vaccine included; concerns about side effects of the vaccine 154(57.0%), 64(23.7%) did not think the vaccines were effective, while 32(11.9%) did not like the vaccines. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of individuals were not willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Health education campaigns on vaccination within urban communities could help reduce COVID-19 vaccine misconceptions in the urban populations more especially the young and persons with low levels of formal education.

N2  - Background: Empathy is a critical component of nursing care, impacting both nurses’ and patients’ outcomes. However, perceived empathy from spouses during pregnancy and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are unclear. This study aimed to examine pregnant women’s perceived empathy from their spouses and assess the relation of perceived empathy on HRQoL. Methods: This cross-sectional study, performed in the obstetric clinics or wards of four well-known hospitals in Anhui Province, China, included 349 pregnant women in the second or third trimester; participants were recruited by convenience sampling and enrolled from October to December 2021. A general information questionnaire, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a purpose-designed empathy questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) were used to evaluate the pregnant women’s general information, perceptions of empathy and HRQoL. Data were analysed using SPSS 22 at a threshold of P < 0.05. Descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Student’s t test, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis were used for analysis. Results: The pregnant women’s total empathy, physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores were 41.6 ± 9.0, 41.6 ± 7.6, and 47.7 ± 9.1, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that the purpose-designed empathy questionnaire items were significantly positively correlated with perspective taking and empathic concern but were not correlated with the personal distress dimension and were only partially correlated with the fantasy dimension. Maternal physical condition during pregnancy, planned pregnancy, and occupational stress were predictors of the PCS score (β = 0.281, P < 0.01; β = 0.132, P = 0.02; β = -0.128, P = 0.02). The behavioural empathy item of our purpose-designed empathy questionnaire and empathic concern were important predictors of the MCS score (β = 0.127, P = 0.02; β = 0.158, P < 0.01), as well as other demographic and obstetric information, explaining 22.0% of the variance in MCS scores totally (F = 12.228, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Pregnant women perceived lower empathy from their spouses and reported lower HRQoL. Perceived empathy, particularly behavioural empathy, may significantly impact pregnant women’s MCS scores but has no effect on their PCS scores. Strategies that foster perceived empathy from spouses among pregnant women are essential for facilitating healthy pregnancies and potentially improving maternal and child health.

N2  - Aim: Sleep disorders during pregnancy can impact maternal and neonatal outcomes. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between sleep quality and maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Educational-Therapeutic Center of Shohadaye Yaftabad Referral Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from December 2020 to September 2022. A total of 198 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the sleep disorders group or the no sleep disorders group. Data were collected through demographic questionnaires, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the checklist for maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results: At baseline, the sleep disorders and no sleep disorders groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index (before pregnancy), education level, employment status, gravida, parity, abortion, and history of COVID-19. Within the sleep disorders group, there was a statistically significant, direct linear correlation between sleep disorders and FBS 34–36 weeks (r = 0.33, P < 0.001) as well as Corona Disease Anxiety (CDA) (r = 0.35, P < 0.001). The linear regression results indicated that for every unit increase in sleep disorders, the risk of FBS 34–36 weeks increased by 1.09 times (β = 1.09, P < 0.001). Additionally, sleep disorders increased the risk of CDA by 1.36 times (β = 1.36, P < 0.001). The results showed no statistically significant differences in terms of birth weight, type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), gestational age (preterm or full term), length of labor stages (first and second stage), Apgar score at minutes 1 and 5, and NICU admission between the two groups. Conclusion: Based on the results, a certain degree of correlation exists between sleep quality and FBS at 34–36 weeks and CDA. These findings underscore the need for future public health guidelines to formulate detailed strategies to improve sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Background: Violence against women (VAW) is a significant public health problem. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency and severity of VAW has escalated globally. Approximately one in four women in Nepal have been exposed to either physical, psychological, and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, with husbands or male partners being the perpetrators in most cases. VAW prevention has been under-researched in low- and middle-income countries, including Nepal. This study aims to explore the perspectives of local stakeholders, including healthcare providers and survivors of violence in Madhesh Province. The overarching goal is to provide insights for designing prevention and support programs that are acceptable to communities and cater to the needs of survivors. Methods: An explorative qualitative study was conducted in Madhesh Province, southern Nepal. A total of 21 interviews, including 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with health care providers, three IDIs with women seeking general or maternal and child health services at health care centres, three key informant interviews with the local stakeholders working in the field of VAW, and one focus group discussion with violence survivors, were conducted in Nepali by trained field interviewers. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated into English, and analysed using content analysis. Results: VAW, particularly physical violence, was a common experience in the study area. Sociocultural traditions such as dowry, child marriages and son preference were identifiable triggers for VAW, causing significant physical injuries and mental health problems, including suicide. Health care providers reported that violence survivors often hide their experiences of violence and do not seek any kind of help. Women feared that violence would increase in frequency and intensity if their perpetrators found out that they had disclosed their experiences of violence to health care providers. Local stakeholders emphasized the importance of engaging community leaders and garnering support from both women and men in interventions designed to reduce VAW and its impacts on mental health. Conclusions: Participants reported that verbal and physical violence is often perceived as a normal part of women’s lives. Women should be made aware of available support services and empowered and supported to increase access and uptake of these services. Additionally, more individual-based counselling sessions that encourage women to escape violence and its mental health consequences while maintaining privacy and confidentiality are recommended.

N2  - Background: Promoting exclusive breastfeeding can have a great effect in reducing the complications and mortality rate of mother and child. Objective: The study aimed to compare the effects of continuous and intermittent supportive counselling on the self-efficacy and continuity of breastfeeding among Lactating mothers with COVID-19. Methods: The study was a semi-experimental research method and was conducted on 73 mothers with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Ayatollah Mousavi Hospital in Zanjan, Iran from May 2021 to April 2022. In the continuous counselling group, counselling was provided daily for 14 days, while in the intermittent counselling group, counselling was provided once a week for four weeks. Breastfeeding continuity was assessed based on the World Health Organization’s classification, and breastfeeding self-efficacy was measured using Dennis’ standard breastfeeding self-efficacy questionnaire (BSE) up to four months after delivery. The data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent t-tests, paired t-tests, analysis of variance with repeated measures, and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) with a 95% confidence level. Results: The survival analysis revealed that the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding occurred in 17 cases within the continuous counselling group and in 22 cases within the intermittent counselling group. The rates of continuation for exclusive breastfeeding were 52.8% and 40.5% in the continuous and intermittent counselling group respectively. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the continuation of breastfeeding and the trend of changes in the mean scores of breastfeeding self-efficacies between the continuous and intermittent counselling groups. Furthermore, comparing the change in breastfeeding self-efficacy scores between the one-month and four-month follow-ups within the continuous counselling group, a statistically significant increase was observed. Conclusion: The results indicated no difference in the effectiveness of continuous and intermittent counseling methods in improving breastfeeding continuity in women with COVID-19. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of different counseling approaches on breastfeeding outcomes during crises. Trial registration: The study was registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website on 29/06/2021 with the registration code IRCT20150731023423N19.

N2  - Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a growing concern about domestic violence worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the general prevalence of all types of violence and the related effective factors during the COVID-19 outbreak among women living in Saveh, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in 2021 on 423 married women referred to health centers in Saveh who were selected using the cluster method. A demographic information questionnaire and a researcher-made domestic violence questionnaire were used to collect data. Descriptive statistical methods and statistical tests were used to analyze the data and examine the correlation between the intensity (score) of violence with the demographic variables of the samples and their spouses. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22 statistical software. A significance level of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Most of the participants (59.6%) were exposed to domestic violence. The mean±standard deviation of the overall domestic violence score was as much as 7.47±12.37. The most common type of domestic violence among the studied women was psychological violence. There was a direct and significant relationship between the overall score of domestic violence, the age of the samples and their spouses, and the duration of their marriage (P<0.01). The average overall score of domestic violence was significantly higher in samples who had children, were not pregnant, had drug and alcohol-addicted spouses, were renters, had a decrease in income during the COVID-19 outbreak, and had unemployed spouses (P <0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results, the prevalence of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic was moderate, but its severity was low. Due to the psychological effects of the COVID-19 disease on society people, the increase in the incidence of violent behavior is especially evident in vulnerable families such as low-income families and tenants and women whose spouses are unemployed and abuse substances. Therefore, identifying and supporting vulnerable families for their education and empowerment can reduce the incidence of domestic violence.

N2  - Background: The pandemic has had a significant impact on the daily lives of children and their families, particularly the children of health care workers, due to changes in family routines as a result of their parents’ work schedules. We aimed to explore the socioemotional and behavioural (SEB) problems of children of healthcare worker mothers (HCWM) during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare them with age-matched children and their mothers from other occupations. Method: A case-control study design was applied, and a snowball approach was used to enrol volunteered participants aged between 6 and 36 months of age, through a Google survey. We used the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) questionnaire to assess children’s SEB problems and a Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) to evaluate the psychological distress of mothers. Differences in BITSEA, BSI and MSPSS scores were examined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of children’s behavioural and emotional problems. Results: In total, 600 questionnaires were analysed. It was observed that children in the HCWM group were separated from their mothers more often and for longer periods of time than their counterparts (p < 0.010, p = 0.002). Changes in the child’s structured outdoor activities during the pandemic period were more likely to be observed in the HCWM group (p < 0.05). The percentage of children with the BITSEA problem subscale above the subclinical cut-off, externalizing and dysregulation scores were significantly higher in the HCWM group (p = 0.044, p = 0.031, and p = 0.016). Moreover, each point increase in BSI global index scores (p < 0.001, RR:3.34, 95%CI:1.91–5.82) was found as a risk factor for clinically significant SEB problems. Conclusion: Overall, the current study suggests HCWM’s have experienced occupational inequality, and young children of HCWM’s were at increased risk for externalizing and dysregulation problems during the pandemic. Maternal psychological stress had a significant impact on their children’s socio-emotional well-being.

N2  - Background: Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers/childbearing parents has mainly been cross-sectional and focused on psychological symptoms. This study examined the impact on function using ongoing, systematic screening of a representative Ontario sample. Methods: An interrupted time series analysis of repeated cross-sectional data from a province-wide screening program using the Healthy Babies Healthy Children (HBHC) tool assessed changes associated with the pandemic at the time of postpartum discharge from hospital. Postal codes were used to link to neighborhood-level data. The ability to parent or care for the baby/child and other psychosocial and behavioral outcomes were assessed. Results: The co-primary outcomes of inability to parent or care for the baby/child were infrequently observed in the pre-pandemic (March 9, 2019–March 15, 2020) and initial pandemic periods (March 16, 2020–March 23, 2021) (parent 209/63,006 (0.33%)–177/56,117 (0.32%), care 537/62,955 (0.85%)–324/56,086 (0.58%)). Changes after pandemic onset were not observed for either outcome although a significant (p = 0.02) increase in slope was observed for inability to parent (with questionable clinical significance). For secondary outcomes, worsening was only seen for reported complications during labor/delivery. Significant improvements were observed in the likelihood of being unable to identify a support person to assist with care, need of newcomer support, and concerns about money over time. Conclusions: There were no substantive changes in concerns about ability to parent or care for children. Adverse impacts of the pandemic may have been mitigated by accommodations for remote work and social safety net policies.

N2  - C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein predominantly produced in the liver and regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. CRP belongs to the pentraxin family and is involved in the innate immunity due to its functional properties including complement activation, phagocytosis, and apoptosis. CRP exists in two conformationally different forms: pentameric CRP (pCRP) and monomeric CRP (mCRP), having distinctive bioactivities during inflammatory processes. CRP is a non-specific serum biomarker of infection, inflammation, and tissue damage. Cumulative evidence showed that increased CRP concentrations help in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring of many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Over the past three decades, numerous studies were focused on the analytical precision of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) assays and their ability to detect lower levels of circulating CRP. Furthermore, several data reported that elevated levels of hs-CRP strongly predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases; thus, individuals at high and intermediate risk could benefit from intensive lifestyle measures and preventive therapeutic strategies. Additionally, CRP was recently considered as a valuable indicator of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This narrative review is focused on discussing the clinical usefulness of standard CRP and hs-CRP in a wide range of inflammatory conditions, namely: cardiovascular diseases, infections including COVID-19, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cancers, rheumatic diseases, neurological disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, periodontitis, chronic kidney disease, asthma, sickle cell disease, surgery, transplant rejection, depression, pregnancy, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women faced great challenges and psychological and physiological changes of varying degrees during the omicron epidemic outbreak. It is important to recognize the potential impact of these challenges on the mental health of pregnant women and to provide appropriate resources and support to mitigate their effects. Method: By using the convenience sampling approach, a total of 401 pregnant women from two hospitals of different grades in two cities were included in the survey. The cross-sectional survey was conducted by basic characteristics, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and self-made questionnaire. Results: Insomnia affected 207 participants (51.6%), depression affected 160 participants (39.9%) and anxiety affected 151 participants (37.7%). Moreover, pregnant women in provincial capital city were more likely to experience anxiety, depression and insomnia than those in county-level city (P < 0.01). Pregnant women’s anxiety, depression and insomnia were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection (P < 0.05). However, COVID-19 infection had no appreciable impact on maternal demand for termination of pregnancy and cesarean section (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Pregnant women frequently suffer from anxiety disorder, depression and insomnia as a result of the omicron pandemic in China. During this period, the community and medical professionals should provide more psychological counseling, conduct health education and offer virtual prenatal care to pregnant women (particularly in the provincial capital city).

N2  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic exposures experienced during childhood, for example, neglect. There is growing evidence that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related socioeconomic conditions contributed to an increased risk of ACEs. As public health programs/services are re-evaluated and restored following the state of emergency, it is important to plan using an ACEs-informed lens. The aim of this study was to identify and prioritize initiatives or activities that Public Health Ontario (PHO) could undertake to support Ontario public health units’ work towards ACEs-informed pandemic recovery plans. Methods: The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method was adapted to conduct a priority-setting exercise (May–October 2022). Two online surveys were administered with members of the Healthy Growth and Development (HGD) Evidence Network, comprised of public health unit staff working in child and family health/HGD from Ontario’s 34 public health units. In the first survey, participants were asked to propose activities or initiatives that PHO could undertake to support Ontario public health units’ work towards ACEs-informed planning. In the second survey, participants were asked to score the final list of options against pre-determined prioritization criteria (for example, relevance). Responses were numerically coded and used to calculate prioritization scores, which were used to rank the options. Results: In all, 76% of public health units (n = 26) responded to the first survey to identify options. The 168 proposed ideas were consolidated into a final list of 13 options, which fall under PHO’s scientific and technical support mandate areas (data and surveillance, evidence synthesis, collaboration and networking, knowledge exchange and research). A total of 79% of public health units (n = 27) responded to the follow-up survey to prioritize options. Prioritization scores ranged from 76.4% to 88.6%. The top-ranked option was the establishment of a new provincial ACEs community of practice. Conclusions: Over three quarters of public health units contributed to identifying and ranking 13 options for PHO to support public health units in considering and addressing ACEs through pandemic recovery planning. In consultation with the ACEs and Resilience Community of Practice, recently formed on the basis of this exercise, PHO will continue to use the ranked list of options to inform work-planning activities/priorities.

N2  - Background: Experiencing a miscarriage can have profound psychological implications, and the added strain of the COVID-19 pandemic may have compounded these effects. This study aimed to explore the psychological experiences, assess the levels of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder), and examine the relationships of personal significance of miscarriage and perceived stress with psychological distress of women in North Carolina who suffered a miscarriage of a desired pregnancy between March 30, 2020, and February 24, 2021, of the COVID-19 pandemic, at 14 to 31 months after the loss. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional mixed-methods study using a convergent parallel design. A total of 71 participants from North Carolina completed the online survey and 18 completed in-depth interviews. The survey assessed demographics, mental health and reproductive history, personal significance of miscarriage, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Interview questions asked about the psychological experience of the miscarriage and how the COVID-19 pandemic affected them and their experience. Results: Findings indicated moderate to severe levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, which persisted 14 to 31 months post-miscarriage. After conducting hierarchical binary logistic regressions, we found that perceived stress and prior trauma increased the odds of depression, perceived stress increased the odds of anxiety, and personal significance and prior trauma increased the odds of PTSD symptoms 14–31 months post-miscarriage. Notably, a subsequent successful childbirth emerged as a protective factor against depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Qualitative findings depicted emotions such as profound isolation, guilt, and grief. Women noted that additional pandemic-specific stressors exacerbated their distress. The categories identified via conventional content analysis fell under five broader thematic groups: mental health disorders, negative emotions/feelings, positive emotions/feelings, thoughts, and other experiences. Conclusions: Miscarriage during the COVID-19 pandemic intensified and added complexity to the psychological distress experienced by affected women. The study underscores the need for comprehensive mental health screenings, specialized support for vulnerable groups, and the necessity of trauma-informed care. Providers are strongly encouraged to adopt a multifaceted, individualized approach to patient care that is cognizant of the unique stressors introduced by the pandemic.

N2  - Background: Research in the neurosciences has highlighted the importance of intersubjective relationships in promoting neuromental development of the child. Children’s learning in early childhood occurs mainly in a dyadic context of an interaction with their parents: from this perspective, good dialogic parent–child communication is required to be promoted also through good educational practices. Dialogic Book-Sharing (DBS), a dialogic form of parent–child communication through the use of wordless picture books, provides a privileged ‘intersubjective’ space and is highly effective in promoting communication, language, attention, behavioural development and the parent–child relationship. DBS programme, successfully previously trialled in South Africa and the UK, will be applied for the first time in Italy for research purposes in Italian health, educational and maternal-child centres. Methods: A multicentre randomised controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate DBS parenting intervention for children aged between 14 and 20 months. Parent–child dyads are randomly allocated to a book-sharing intervention group or to a wait-list control group. In the intervention, parents are trained in supportive book-sharing with their children by local staff of the centres. DBS intervention is carried out in small groups over a period of 4 weeks. Data are collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 6 months post-intervention with a questionnaire and video recording of parent–child interaction. Discussion: DBS programme in early childhood could enhance the educational resources offered by Italian health, educational and maternal-child centres, in support of child’s development and parenting. DBS represents a strategic opportunity for bringing about positive effects, also in terms of prevention of socio-emotional and cognitive difficulties. As such it represents a promising response to the new social, health and educational needs of the post-COVID-19 pandemic era caused by the social isolation measures. Furthermore, the application of the DBS methodology is a way to promote the use of books, and thereby counteract the excessive use of technological devices already present in early childhood. Trial registration: The trial is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number database, registration number ISRCTN11755019 Registered on 2 November 2023. This is version 1 of the protocol for the trial.

N2  - In the United States, maternal health inequities disproportionately affect Global Majority (e.g., Asian, Black, and Hispanic) populations. Despite a substantial body of research underscoring the influence of racism on these inequities, little research has examined how experiences of gendered racial microaggressions during pregnancy and birth impact racially and ethnically diverse Global Majority pregnant and birthing people in obstetric hospital settings. We evaluated the psychometric properties of an adapted version of Lewis &amp;#x0026; Neville’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale, using data collected from 417 Global Majority birthing people. Findings from our study indicate that our adapted GRMS is a valid tool for assessing the experiences of gendered racial microaggressions in hospital-based obstetric care settings among Global Majority pregnant and birthing people whose preferred languages are English or Spanish. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis demonstrated high construct validity of the adapted GRMS scale (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.1089 (95% CI 0.0921, 0.1263), Comparative Fit Index = 0.977, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.075, log-likelihood c2 = -85.6, df = 8). IRT analyses demonstrated that the unidimensional model was preferred to the bi-dimensional model as it was more interpretable, had lower AIC and BIC, and all items had large discrimination parameters onto a single factor (all discrimination parameters &amp;#x003E; 3.0). Given that we found similar response profiles among Black and Hispanic respondents, our Differential Item Functioning analyses support validity among Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-speaking birthing people. Inter-item correlations demonstrated adequate scale reliability, α = 0.97, and empirical reliability = 0.67. Pearsons correlations was used to assess the criterion validity of our adapted scale. Our scale’s total score was significantly and positively related to postpartum depression and anxiety. Researchers and practitioners should seek to address instances of gendered racial microaggressions in obstetric settings, as they are manifestations of systemic and interpersonal racism, and impact postpartum health.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on gynecology surgical training. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all trainees and trainers in the higher specialist training program for obstetrics and gynecology in Ireland. The survey consisted of questions on topics which included: the volume of surgical procedures performed before and since the pandemic, confidence in performing various gynecologic procedures before and since the pandemic and questions regarding the impact of the pandemic on wellbeing and work practices. Results: Trainers and trainees experienced a significant reduction in operative volumes for most procedure types. Analysis showed a significant reduction in the number of minor procedures performed by trainees (z = −2.7, P = 0.007) and a significant reduction in the number of all procedure types performed by trainers (minor procedures z = −3.78, P = <0.001; intermediate procedures z = −4.48, P = < 0.001; major procedures z = −3.69, P = < 0.001). Respondents reported they had less time for research and audit, were less able to attend courses or conferences and worried about the impact of their work on their families. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study has highlighted the current difficulties facing surgical trainees in gynecology because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges have compounded an already challenging training environment for gynecology trainees. Efforts must be made to continue to provide high-quality tailored training to ensure the development of the next generation of gynecologic surgeons.

N2  - Background: In recognition of the burden of Perinatal Mental Health problems, NHS England invested £365 million to transform women’s access to mental health care, including investment in Community Perinatal Mental Health Services. This study examined how elements of provider care affected women’s engagement with these services. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 139 women and explored their experiences of care from 10 different Community Perinatal Mental Health Teams; including which service components participants believed made a difference to their initial and continued engagement. Realist analysis was used to create context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) across interviews, since not all parts of the configurations were always articulated within singular interviews. Results: Four key pillars for engagement were identified: perinatal competence, relationship building, accurate reassurance, and reliability. The way perinatal competencies were relayed to women mattered; compassion, understanding and consistency were critical interactional styles. The extent to which these factors affected women’s engagement varied by their context and personal characteristics. Conclusions: As mental health problems increase, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, it is critical to continue to ensure support is not only available, but appropriately meets the needs of those individuals. Our findings suggest that key staff behaviours applied at the right time can support women’s engagement and potentially contribute to better treatment outcomes.

N2  - Background: This update outlines amendments to the CHAMPION2/STRIPES2 cluster randomised trial protocol primarily made due to the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown in India in 2020. These amendments were in line with national guidelines for health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did not change the original trial design, eligibility, and outcomes. Amendments were introduced to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission and ensure safety and wellbeing of trial staff, participants, and other villagers. CHAMPION2 intervention: participatory learning and action (PLA) and fixed day service (FDS) meeting were revised to incorporate social distancing and hygiene precautions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PLA participation was limited to pregnant women and birthing partners. STRIPES2 intervention: before/after-school classes were halted for a period and then modified temporarily (reducing class sizes, and/or changing meeting places) with hygiene and safe distancing practices introduced. Data collection: The research team gathered as much information as possible from participants by telephone. If the participant had no telephone or could not be contacted by telephone, data were collected in person. COVID-19 precautions: trial teams were trained on COVID-19 precautions and used personal protective equipment whilst in the villages for trial-related activities. After restarting the trial between June and September 2020 in a phased manner, some trial activities were suspended again in all the trial villages from April to June 2021 due to the second wave of COVID-19 cases and lockdown imposed in Satna, Madhya Pradesh. Trial timelines were also revised, with outcomes measured later than originally planned. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2019/05/019296.

N2  - Background: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Understanding the willingness of the community to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will help in the development and implementation of effective COVID-19 vaccination promotion programs. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and associated factors among residents of Dire Dawa Administration, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 840 residents in Dire Dawa Administration from May 18th to June 18th, 2021. Multistage cluster sampling followed by systematic random sampling was used to select respondents. A pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from respondents. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The odds ratio (OR), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI), was used to estimate the strength of the association. Results: Out of 840 respondents recruited, the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was found to be 54.4% (457/840); (95% CI: 51.0%, 57.7%) Being male [AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: (1.35, 2.54), P < 0.001], not having a current habit of substance use [AOR = 2.38, 95% CI: (1.73, 3.26), P < 0.001], having a monthly income of less than 51.31 USD [AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: (0.04, 0.88), P = 0.001]; and not having a prior history of vaccination experience [AOR = 0.40, 95% CI: (0.29, 0.54), P < 0.001] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: This study reveals that the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among residents of Dire Dawa Administration, Eastern Ethiopia, was 54.4%. Factors like being male and not having a current habit of substance use were positively associated, whereas having a monthly income of less than 51.31 USD and not having a prior history of vaccination experience were negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Health information dissemination and economic empowerment are crucial to improving COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the community. This study provides valuable data for policymakers to plan early vaccination programs and tackle the challenges identified in the study.

N2  - Due to rapid technological advancements, remote patient monitoring (RPM) technology has gained traction in recent years. While the effects of specific RPM interventions are known, few published reviews examine RPM in the context of care transitions from an inpatient hospital setting to a home environment. In this systematic review, we addressed this gap by examining the impacts of RPM interventions on patient safety, adherence, clinical and quality of life outcomes and cost-related outcomes during care transition from inpatient care to a home setting. We searched five academic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and SCOPUS), screened 2606 articles, and included 29 studies from 16 countries. These studies examined seven types of RPM interventions (communication tools, computer-based systems, smartphone applications, web portals, augmented clinical devices with monitoring capabilities, wearables and standard clinical tools for intermittent monitoring). RPM interventions demonstrated positive outcomes in patient safety and adherence. RPM interventions also improved patients’ mobility and functional statuses, but the impact on other clinical and quality-of-life measures, such as physical and mental health symptoms, remains inconclusive. In terms of cost-related outcomes, there was a clear downward trend in the risks of hospital admission/readmission, length of stay, number of outpatient visits and non-hospitalisation costs. Future research should explore whether incorporating intervention components with a strong human element alongside the deployment of technology enhances the effectiveness of RPM. The review highlights the need for more economic evaluations and implementation studies that shed light on the facilitators and barriers to adopting RPM interventions in different care settings.

N2  - Uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant persons is lower than the general population. This scoping review explored pregnant people’s attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and whether attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines differ by country of origin. A scoping review was conducted across PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were articles published in English from 2019–2022 focused on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant persons. Data analysis was done via the 5Cs framework for vaccine hesitancy: Constraints, Complacency, Calculation, Confidence, and Collective Responsibility. 44 articles were extracted. A lack of confidence in vaccine safety was the most prevalent theme of hesitancy among pregnant persons. This was largely driven by a lack of access to information about the vaccine as well as mistrust of the vaccine and medical professionals. Meanwhile, vaccine acceptance was mostly driven by a desire to protect themselves and their loved ones. Overall, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant persons continues to be high. Vaccine hesitancy is primarily driven by fear of the unknown side effects of the vaccine on pregnant persons and their fetuses along with a lack of information and medical mistrust. Some differences can be seen between high income and low- and middle-income countries regarding vaccine hesitancy, showing that a single solution cannot be applied to all who are vaccine hesitant. General strategies, however, can be utilized to reduce vaccine hesitancy, including advocating for inclusion of pregnant persons in clinical trials and incorporating consistent COVID-19 vaccine counseling during prenatal appointments.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy termination is an essential component of reproductive healthcare. In Southern Africa, an estimated 23% of all pregnancies end in termination of pregnancy, against a backdrop of high rates of unintended pregnancies and unsafe pregnancy terminations, which contributes to maternal morbidity and mortality. Understanding the reasons for pregnancy termination may remain incomplete if seen in isolation of interpersonal (including family, peer, and partner), community, institutional, and public policy factors. This study therefore aimed to use a socio-ecological framework to qualitatively explore, in Soweto, South Africa, i) reasons for pregnancy termination amongst women aged 18–28 years, and ii) factors characterising the decision to terminate. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted between February to March 2022 with ten participants of varying parity, who underwent a termination of pregnancy since being enrolled in the Bukhali trial, set in Soweto, South Africa. A semi-structured, in-depth interview guide, based on the socioecological domains, was used. The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, and a deductive approach. Results: An application of the socio-ecological framework indicated that the direct reasons to terminate a pregnancy fell into the individual and interpersonal domains of the socioecological framework. Key reasons included financial dependence and insecurity, feeling unready to have a child (again), and a lack of support from family and partners for the participant and their pregnancy. In addition to these reasons, Factors that characterised the participants’ decision experience were identified across all socio-ecological domains and included the availability of social support and (lack of) accessibility to termination services. The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown policies also indirectly impacted participants’ decisions through detrimental changes in interpersonal support and financial situation. Conclusions: Amongst the South African women included in this study, the decision to terminate a pregnancy was made within a complex structural and social context. Insight into the reasons why women choose to terminate helps to better align legal termination services with women’s needs across multiple sectors, for example by reducing judgement within healthcare settings and improving access to social and mental health support.

N2  - Background: Testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with higher rates of detrimental psycho-social and physical health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to everyday life. This included major reconfiguration of maternal, child, and perinatal mental health and care services and provision. This study aimed to investigate the experiences of those who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy, labour and birth, or the early postnatal period. Methods: National on-line recruitment from across the United Kingdom resulted in sixteen mothers being invited to qualitative semi-structured interviews to understand the experiences of mothers who had been infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, labour and birth, or the early postnatal period. Interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed using video-conferencing software. A Grounded Theory approach was used to analyse the data gathered pertaining to women’s experiences of their positive COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy, labour and birth, or the early postnatal period. Results: The theory of ‘Oscillating Autonomy – Losing and Seeking to Regain Control by Striving for Agency’ was developed, comprising three main themes: ‘Anxious Anticipation: The fear of infection was worse than COVID-19 itself’; ‘Fluctuating Agency: What changed when COVID-19 took control’; and ‘Reclaiming Control: Seeking reassurance during COVID-19 positivity’. Testing positive for COVID-19 whilst pregnant, during labour or birth, or in the early postnatal period was associated with a perceived loss of control. Those who were able to regain that control felt more secure in their situation. Conclusions: Support was paramount to manage increased vulnerability, as was reassurance achieved by information seeking and positive action including increased health monitoring and COVID-19 vaccination.

N2  - Background: Women who suffer an early pregnancy loss require specific clinical care, aftercare, and ongoing support. In the UK, the clinical management of early pregnancy complications, including loss is provided mainly through specialist Early Pregnancy Assessment Units. The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the way in which maternity and gynaecological care was delivered, as health systems moved to rapidly reconfigure and re-organise services, aiming to reduce the risk and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PUDDLES is an international collaboration investigating the pandemic’s impact on care for people who suffered a perinatal bereavement. Presented here are initial qualitative findings undertaken with UK-based women who suffered early pregnancy losses during the pandemic, about how they navigated the healthcare system and its restrictions, and how they were supported. Methods: In-keeping with a qualitative research design, in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with an opportunity sample of women (N = 32) who suffered any early pregnancy loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analysed using a template analysis to understand women’s access to services, care, and networks of support, during the pandemic following their pregnancy loss. The thematic template was based on findings from parents who had suffered a late-miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in the UK, during the pandemic. Results: All women had experienced reconfigured maternity and early pregnancy services. Data supported themes of: 1) COVID-19 Restrictions as Impractical & Impersonal; 2) Alone, with Only Staff to Support Them; 3) Reduction in Service Provision Leading to Perceived Devaluation in Care; and 4) Seeking Their Own Support. Results suggest access to early pregnancy loss services was reduced and pandemic-related restrictions were often impractical (i.e., restrictions added to burden of accessing or receiving care). Women often reported being isolated and, concerningly, aspects of early pregnancy loss services were reported as sub-optimal. Conclusions: These findings provide important insight for the recovery and rebuilding of health services in the post-pandemic period and help us prepare for providing a higher standard of care in the future and through any other health system shocks. Conclusions made can inform future policy and planning to ensure best possible support for women who experience early pregnancy loss.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates are particularly vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). These VPDs are associated with high morbidity and mortality among expectant mothers and their fetuses and neonates. Vaccination during pregnancy can protect the expectant mother from VPDs to which she may be especially vulnerable while pregnant. In addition, the passive transfer of maternal neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) also protects the fetus against congenital infections and may further protect the neonate from infection during the first few months of life. Despite this, coverage of recommended maternal vaccines remains suboptimal globally, especially in resource-constrained settings. Determinants of vaccine acceptance and uptake are frequently understudied in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and among specific groups such as pregnant and postpartum women. This proposed systematic review will assess the acceptance and uptake of vaccines against tetanus, influenza, pertussis, and COVID-19 among pregnant and postpartum women in LMICs. Methods: A Boolean search strategy employing common and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for tetanus, influenza, pertussis, and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, together with uptake, pregnancy, and postpartum, will be used to search electronic databases for relevant literature published between 2009 and 2024. Only studies conducted in LMICs that investigated determinants of acceptance, hesitancy, and uptake of tetanus, influenza, pertussis, and COVID-19 vaccines among pregnant and postpartum women will be eligible for inclusion in the review. The quality and the risk of bias of all eligible full-text articles will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s (JBI) critical appraisal tools. Discussion: This protocol proposes a systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to assess the uptake of maternal vaccines and to systematically appraise and quantify determinants of the acceptance and uptake of recommended vaccines during pregnancy and postpartum in LMICs. A better understanding of these factors and how they influence maternal vaccine decision-making will enable public health practitioners as well as global and national policymakers to design more effective interventions as we look towards expanding the scope and reach of maternal immunization programs.

N2  - Background: Pregnant patients were a significant population to consider during the pandemic, given the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on obstetric outcomes. While COVID testing was a central pillar of infection control, it became apparent that a subset of the population declined to test. At the same time, data emerged about pregnant persons also declining testing. Yet, it was unknown why pregnant patients declined tests and if those reasons were similar or different from those of the general population. We conducted this study to explore pregnant patients’ attitudes, access, and utilization of COVID-19 testing to support healthcare for infection prevention management for this unique and medically complex population. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study of patients who were currently or recently pregnant during the early stages of the pandemic and received outpatient prenatal care at one of the participating study sites. An interview guide was used to conduct in-depth telephone interviews. Coding was performed using NVivo, and analysis was conducted using Grounded Theory. Results: The average age of the participants (N = 37) was 32 (SD 4.21) years. Most were < 35 years of age (57%) and self-described as White (68%). Qualitative analysis identified themes related to barriers to COVID-19 testing access and use during pregnancy, including concerns about test accuracy, exposure to COVID-19 in testing facilities, isolation and separation during labor and delivery, and diminished healthcare quality and patient experience. Conclusions: The implementation of widespread and universal COVID testing policies did not address the unique needs and challenges of pregnant patients as a medically complex population. It is important to understand the reasons and implications for pregnant patients who declined COVID testing during the current pandemic to inform strategies to prevent infection spread in future public health emergencies.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine health care and antenatal and birth services globally. The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) based at the Thailand-Myanmar border provides cross border antenatal care (ANC) and birth services to marginalised pregnant women. The border between the countries entered lockdown in March 2020 preventing cross-border access for women from Myanmar to Thailand. SMRU adapted by opening a new clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar. This study explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on access to ANC and pregnancy outcomes for marginalised pregnant women in the border regions between Thailand and Myanmar. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of all pregnancies delivered or followed at antenatal clinics of the SMRU from 2017 to the end of 2022. Logistic regression was done to compare the odds of maternal and neonatal outcomes between women who delivered pre-COVID (2017–2019) and women who delivered in the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022), grouped by reported country of residence: Thailand or Myanmar. Results: Between 2017 and the end of 2022, there were 13,865 (5,576 resident in Thailand and 8,276 in Myanmar) marginalised pregnant women who followed ANC or gave birth at SMRU clinics. Outcomes of pregnancy were known for 9,748 women with an EGA ≥ 28 weeks. Unknown outcome of pregnancy among women living in Thailand did not increase during the pandemic. However, there was a high (60%) but transient increase in unknown outcome of pregnancy for women with Myanmar residence in March 2020 following border closure and decreasing back to the baseline of 20–30% after establishment of a new clinic. Non-literate women were more likely to have an unknown outcome during the pandemic. There was no statistically significant increase in known stillbirths or maternal deaths during the COVID pandemic in this population but homebirth was over represented in maternal and perinatal mortality. Conclusion: Decreasing barriers to healthcare for marginalised pregnant women on the Thailand-Myanmar border by establishment of a new clinic was possible in response to sudden border closure during the COVID-19 pandemic and most likely preventing an increase in maternal and perinatal mortality.

N2  - Background: Prehypertension is one of the common disorders during pregnancy. Reducing salt intake is among the best cost-effective interventions to reduce the risk of hypertension. The present study aimed to explore the effect of an educational intervention based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on amount of salt consumed by prehypertensive pregnant women. Methods: The present quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2022 on 61 prehypertensive pregnant women visiting the Comprehensive Health Services Centers in Birjand, Iran. Pregnant women were selected through a convenience sampling method and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. A blood pressure test and a 24-hour urine test were taken in 3 stages (before, immediately after, and one month after the intervention). A reliable and valid questionnaire based on the TPB was used to measure the cognitive variables. The intervention program included three training sessions based on the TPB held on an online platform (WhatsApp social network). Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and longitudinal marginal model with the GEE approach in SPSS19. The significance level for all statistical tests was set at p < 0 0.05. Results: After intervention, the mean score of perceived behavioral control (p = 0.02), intention (p = 0.004), and salt consumption behavior (p = 0.03) increased significantly in the intervention group, and the mean score of systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01) decreased significantly in this group. In the control group, a statistically significant difference was observed in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the subjects (p < 0.01). However, the score of attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intention, salt consumption behavior and the daily salt intake did not show a statistically significant difference over time (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The present findings showed that the perceived behavioral control, intention, behavior, systolic and diastolic blood pressure can be modifiable variables to improve the amount of salt consumed by pre-hypertensive pregnant women. Therefore, we recommend that the present model be used to develop interventions to improve health indicators in pregnant women as a highly susceptible group in society.

N2  - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has become an essential lifesaving intervention for individuals with severe cardiovascular and respiratory failure. Its application is expanding across several therapeutic contexts, surpassing conventional indications. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed worldwide health systems to manage acute respiratory failure. ECMO has been employed as a vital intervention, particularly for patients with severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ECMO is applicable throughout pregnancy. The principal indications for ECMO in pregnant women align with those in the general population. However, pregnancy complicates issues, necessitating consideration of both mother’s and infant’s well-being. Patients with systemic rheumatic diseases are prone to experience life-threatening complications. While a majority of these patients respond to immunosuppressive drugs, a small percentage suffer organ failure and may benefit from ECMO as a bridge to recovery. The article addresses coagulation therapies, highlighting the necessity of precise anticoagulation to avert both bleeding and thrombosis, particularly in patients requiring extended ECMO support. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in ECMO patients are summarized, including the influence of the ECMO circuit on drug metabolism. Survey-based research offers valuable insights into ECMO use, procedures, and challenges. The paper evaluates current survey-based research and ECMO guidelines, highlighting clinical practice, training, and resource availability discrepancies across ECMO centers globally. Particular focus is placed on the rehabilitation requirements of ECMO survivors, acknowledging the importance of early mobilization and post-discharge care in improving long-term outcomes and quality of life.

N2  - Background: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 highlighting the importance of social distancing guidelines. Following a series of lockdowns and the widespread vaccination of the European population, many countries began to lift these restrictions. During this period, while some parents yearned for emotional support and family presence, others found that the solitude facilitated by the restrictions was beneficial for bonding and breastfeeding. In France, postnatal stays are generally longer than in other countries, and the limited availability of home-based follow-up care, combined with pandemic isolation measures, further complicated perspectives on visitation restrictions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the satisfaction of mothers and caregivers regarding these visit restrictions in French maternity settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted two multicentre descriptives surveys across five French maternity wards (three in Paris and two in Lyon) from June 1st to July 15th, 2021. Participants included mothers, selected based on criteria such as French-speaking, at-term birth (≥ 37 weeks), and hospitalisation with their newborn, as well as caregivers working in the postpartum units. Satisfaction with visitation restrictions was assessed using a four-point Likert scale, which was then dichotomised into “mostly satisfied” versus “mostly dissatisfied” for the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with satisfaction. Results: We analysed complete responses from 430 of the 2,142 mothers (20.1%) and 221 of the 385 caregivers (57.4%) who participated during the study period. The majority of mothers (68.8%, n = 296/430) and caregivers (90.5%, n = 200/221) declare themselves satisfied with the policy of restricting visits to maternity wards. The main source of mother’s satisfaction came from a quieter stay, but they regretted the absence of their other children. Conclusions: Maternity visit restriction policies were largely supported by mothers and caregivers, especially when partners and siblings were allowed. Revisiting these policies, along with the postpartum stay length, may improve care, though further evaluation in non-pandemic settings is needed.

N2  - Introduction: Melatonin has been suggested to have a biological role in the onset and progress of labor. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of melatonin during an induction of labor will reduce the need for a cesarean birth. Material and Methods: This trial underwent protocol amendments that are detailed in the main text of the article. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000311459). At a multi-center health service including secondary and tertiary obstetric hospitals, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women with a singleton cephalic pregnancy, free of significant maternal or perinatal complications who were undergoing induction of labor (with or without cervical ripening). Women were randomized to 10 mg melatonin vs placebo, with cervical ripening as required, and then 6-h during their induction of labor to a maximum of four doses or until birth. The primary outcome was cesarean birth. Secondary outcomes included labor, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Data were analyzed using intention to treat. Sub-group analyses based on mode of ripening and parity were also performed. Results: Between 2019 and 2021 we randomized 189 women (103 to melatonin and 86 to placebo). The study was prematurely terminated due to logistical complications resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Cesarean rates were 28/103 (27.2%) in the melatonin group vs 20/84 (23.3%) in the placebo group (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.71–1.92). There were no significant differences in rate of cesarean birth between the melatonin and placebo groups for failure to progress (13.4% and 9.3%, respectively, RR 1.46; 95% CI 0.64–3.32) or suspected fetal distress (10.7% and 10.5%, respectively, RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.44–2.34). The melatonin group had significantly lower rates of spontaneous vaginal birth within 24 h (35.0% vs. 50.0%; RR 0.70 95% CI 0.50–0.98). The rates of secondary outcomes such as total length of labor, rate of postpartum hemorrhage, and instrumental birth were comparable. Babies born in the melatonin group were more likely to need admission to the special care nursery, namely for hypoglycemic monitoring (18.5% vs. 8.1% RR 2.26; 95% CI 1.00–5.10). Conclusions: In women undergoing induction of labor, melatonin does not reduce the cesarean section rate. Melatonin use intrapartum may also be associated with neonatal hypoglycemia.

N2  - Objective: The Family Integrated Care (FICare) model improves outcomes for preterm infants and parents compared with family-centered care (FCC). FICare with mobile technology (mFICare) may improve uptake and impact. Research on FICare in the United States (US) is scarce and little is known about parents' experience. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with nine parents, exploring their NICU experiences, participation in and perceptions of the mFICare program. A directed content analysis approach was used, and common themes were derived from the data. Results: Overall, parents had positive NICU experiences and found mFICare helpful in meeting three common parenting priorities: actively caring for their infant, learning how to care for their infant, and learning about the clinical status of their infant. They described alignment and misalignment with mFICare components relative to their personal parenting priorities and offered suggestions for improvement. Nurses were noted to play key roles in providing or facilitating parent support and encouragement to participate in mFICare and parenting activities. Conclusion: The mFICare program showed potential for parental acceptance and participation in US NICUs. Innovation: The mFICare model is an innovation in neonatal care that can advance the consistent delivery of NICU family-centered care planning and caregiving. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03418870 01/02/2018.

N2  - Background: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has become an endemic disease of global public health importance. Mass COVID-19 vaccination has been an essential global control strategy amidst challenges of limited acceptance. Because of globalization, COVID-19/similar diseases vaccination acceptance and the determinants in any particular setting are important global public health issues. Using a novel and pragmatic framework, this study explored determinants of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among community members during the pandemic in Ebonyi state, Nigeria, and made policy-relevant recommendations on how to increase vaccination acceptance in subsequent outbreaks/pandemics. Methods: This qualitative study was based on the novel and pragmatic Individual Experiences and Perceptions and Complacency, Confidence, Convenience, and Compulsion (Four ‘Cis’) Determinants of Vaccination Acceptance Conceptual Framework – Omale INDEPT FORCIS Framework. On April 26 and 27, 2022, 20 semi-structured face-to-face focus group discussions were conducted in local language and pidgin English with 100 purposively selected consenting/assenting community members aged 15 years and above who had resided in the community for at least one year. Data was analysed using deductive (with some inductive) thematic analytic approach. Results: The many, diverse, and significant determinants of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance found were factors that were individual-related (individual experiences and perceptions and knowledge about COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccine/vaccination, and the vaccination process/system, sociodemographic, individual’s condition (e.g. pregnancy)); COVID-19-related (factuality, transmissibility, frequency, severity, fatality); COVID-19 vaccine/vaccination-related (safety/side-effects, effectiveness, speedy production); COVID-19 vaccination process/system-related (real availability/accessibility); family, group, and other individual-related (experiences and perceptions and actions); and broader local, national, international, and global (LONING) context-related (socio-political, economic, historic, health system factors). The broader LONING contextual factors included the unprecedented disinformation/conspiracy theories, non-sustained COVID-19 risk/behaviour change communication, enforcement and non-enforcement or termination of peculiar control policies/measures (lockdowns, social/physical distancing, use of face mask etc.), mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies, provision of incentives, past experiences regarding the Ebola viral disease outbreak, (un)trustworthiness of the Nigerian health system and her international/global partners, and the (un)trustworthiness of the governments in Nigeria and bad/good governance, inclusive of the failure of the Ebonyi state government to distribute the COVID-19 palliatives to the people during the lockdowns. Conclusion: The evidence illuminates complex and interrelated, specific underlying, and peculiar policy-relevant LONING determinants of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and emphasizes the need for concerted and comprehensive LONING strategies (involving all the relevant LONING stakeholders/policy makers) in addressing these determinants to increase vaccination acceptance among community members in subsequent outbreaks/pandemics in Ebonyi state/Nigeria and similar settings.

N2  - Background: Malaria during pregnancy leads to many deaths in Africa. COVID-19 contributed to more malaria cases due to interruptions in prevention efforts. Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPTP) is an effective malaria prevention strategy for pregnant women, but adoption barriers still exist. The study aim was to explore barriers to the adoption of IPTP at Kawempe National Referral Hospital (KNRH) Uganda. Methods: In a qualitative study design, data was collected using focus group discussions. A total of 37 postpartum mothers were interviewed in six focus group discussions. The interviews were conducted using a structured guide to explore barriers to IPTP implementation at KNRH. The data was transcribed, coded, and analysed using NVivo 10. Results: The study found that mothers lacked adequate knowledge about IPTP, faced socioeconomic and cultural constraints, fear of side effects, a high pill burden, and experience of health system challenges as major themes of barriers to optimal IPTP use. Conclusions and recommendations: Challenges in the service delivery and inadequate information in regard to importance and expected side effects were identified by the users as the major barriers to IPTP delivery in public health care setting. Improving delivery of focused health education talks and health work attitude and delivery chain for IPTP in the health facilities are recommended to increase its uptake.

N2  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The first presentation’s possible triggers are still controversial among scientists. The objective of this study is to investigate and compare the potential social, environmental, and physical factors that may have contributed to the onset of MS before and during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed in the MS research center of Sina Hospital and also distributed as an online Google Form on social media among Iranian MS patients. Demographic information, MS disease-related data, and possible patients reported MS triggers were recorded. They were containing stressful life events, COVID-19 and other infections, COVID-19 and other vaccines, pregnancy or labor, head trauma, surgery, and weight loss. Patients were divided into two groups regarding the time of MS diagnosis (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). Results: Of 920 participants, 670 (72.8%) were female, and the mean age ± SD was 35.63 ± 8.1. The majority of patients (69.2%) had non-progressive forms of MS, and only 7.6% needed assistance for ambulation. 69% of participants were diagnosed with MS before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference between the most common first MS symptom before and after the beginning of the pandemic (visual type (n: 317 (49.9%)) before and sensory type (n: 170 (59.6%)) after the COVID-19 pandemic). A stressful life event was the most common patient-reported trigger of MS first presentation in both groups. (56.1% before and 54% after the COVID-19 pandemic). Comparing two groups, economic problems (AOR: 1.81; 95% ACI: 1.23–2.65) and job losses (AOR: 2.89; 95% ACI: 1.37–6.08) were significantly more common triggers for the initial presentation of MS after the pandemic, while the stress of occupational or educational exams (AOR: 0.52; 95% ACI: 0.34–0.79) was more prevalent before the pandemic. Conclusion: Patients believe that stressful life events are closely linked to triggering their first MS symptoms. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic problems and job losses have increased; however, occupational or educational exams stress decreased. Caring for social stress by societies may affect MS development or delay MS onset.

N2  - Background: We systematically reviewed Mendelian randomization (MR) studies and summarized evidence on the potential effects of different antihypertensive drugs on health. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for MR studies evaluating the effects of antihypertensive drug classes on health outcomes until 22 May 2024. We extracted data on study characteristics and findings, assessed study quality, and compared the evidence with that from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results: We identified 2643 studies in the search, of which 37 studies were included. These studies explored a wide range of health outcomes including cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, immune function and infection, and other outcomes. There is strong evidence supporting the protective effects of genetically proxied antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular diseases. We found strong protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on diabetes whereas beta-blockers showed adverse effects. ACE inhibitors might increase the risk of psoriasis, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease but did not affect COVID-19. There is strong evidence that ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are beneficial for kidney and immune function, and CCBs showed a safe profile for disorders of pregnancy. Most studies have high quality. RCT evidence supports the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and CCBs on stroke, diabetes, and kidney function. However, there is a lack of reliable RCTs to confirm the associations with other diseases. Conclusions: Evidence of the benefits and off-target effects of antihypertensive drugs contribute to clinical decision-making, pharmacovigilance, and the identification of drug repurposing opportunities.

N2  - Background: Adolescents exhibit a high prevalence of mental health disorders, with more than half of all cases emerging before the age of 14 years. Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a marked upsurge in anxiety and depression among adolescents across several nations. Emotional disorders often lead to severe outcomes, including school absenteeism, self-harm, and suicidal tendencies. The suboptimal efficacy of pharmacotherapy, compounded by limited availability and substantial costs associated with individual psychotherapy, underscores the critical need for identifying simple yet efficacious psychotherapeutic interventions suitable for both individual and group settings. Tension and Trauma Release Exercise (TRE) is a mind-body therapeutic approach that efficiently alleviates symptoms of anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mother-child intervention model using TRE in enhancing the clinical management of adolescent patients diagnosed with emotional disorders. Methods : This study recruits 140 dyads of adolescents with emotional disorders and their mothers, randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention arm combines eight weeks of standard pharmacotherapy with an eight-week TRE group therapy, assessing at baseline, post-8-week treatment, and three-month follow-up. Initially, controls receive eight weeks of standard medication with parallel assessments, later transitioning to the same TRE intervention while maintaining continuous evaluation. The study further examines the influence of maternal emotional health on adolescent treatment response and investigates associated neurophysiological and psychological mechanisms. Discussion: This research endeavors to identify a straightforward and potent body-oriented psychological intervention that could improve the clinical outcomes for adolescent patients with emotional disorders. Such findings would carry profound implications not only for the healthy development of teenagers but also for potentially mitigating the burden on families, educational institutions, and society as a whole.

N2  - Introduction: : Healthy gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with improved pregnancy and delivery outcomes. Previous literature shows provider advice and expectations regarding GWG significantly associated with GWG outcomes. In this study, we explore the influence of these factors on GWG in a military population in this secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial. Materials and methods: Participants (N = 377) came from a completed randomized controlled trial focused on behavioral interventions for healthy GWG and/or postpartum weight loss among TRICARE beneficiaries. At baseline, participants filled out a 5-item questionnaire assessing provider advice and self-expectations for GWG. For the actual GWG primary outcome variable, we calculated the difference between the weight obtained in the first trimester and the weight obtained at 36 weeks of gestation. We used regression models to assess the predictive ability of expectations about GWG on actual GWG. Results: Participants with higher baseline BMIs were more likely to expect excessive GWG as defined by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM; Overweight: 46.3%, Obesity: 65.4%). Participants’ expectations showed a significant association with actual GWG (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.29–3.41, p = 0.003). Most participants (64.7%) reported no provider advice about how much weight to gain during their pregnancy. Of those who did receive advice, 55.4% reported that it was within the NAM guidelines. Conclusions: The study documented infrequent provider advice about GWG in a large sample of TRICARE beneficiaries (i.e., both active duty and non-active duty individuals) and supported an association between self-expectations and later actual GWG. Future studies might test strategies to increase/improve provider advice regarding GWG and to aid pregnant individuals in shaping and achieving their GWG expectations. Clinical Trial Registration: The trial was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 03057808) on February 20, 2017.

N2  - Background: Biopsychosocial changes during adolescence are thought to confer risk for emotion dysregulation, and in particular, anxiety disorders. However, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge about the biological mechanisms underlying anxiety during adolescence, and whether this contributes to the higher prevalence in females. The Puberty and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescents (PANDA) study aims to examine links between biological (sex hormones, cortisol) and social environmental factors and brain function during adolescence, with a focus on key processes (emotion regulation, fear learning) identified as relevant for the development of anxiety disorders. Methods: PANDA is a cross-sectional study with an observational design that aims to recruit a total of 175 adolescents aged 11-16 (majority female) and their parents/guardians, from the community. Brain function will be examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including functional MRI tasks of emotion regulation and fear learning. Hormones will be measured from hair (i.e., cortisol) and weekly saliva samples (i.e., oestradiol, progesterone, five across a month in females). Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews will be used to assess mental health and social environmental factors such as parenting and adverse childhood experiences. An online study of 113 adolescents was also incorporated during the COVID-19 pandemic as a questionnaire-only sub-study. Discussion: Strengths of this study include the collection of multiple saliva samples to assess variability in hormone levels, examination of the timing of adverse childhood experiences, inclusion of both maternal and paternal parental factors, exploration of mechanisms through the examination of brain structure and function, and multi-method, multi-informant collection of mental health symptoms. This study addresses important gaps in the literature and will enhance knowledge of the biological and environmental contributors to emotion dysregulation and anxiety in adolescents.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global mental health, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population may potentially hinder infant physical development, underscoring the necessity for specific interventions. This study seeks to explore the prevalence of PTSD among pregnant women during the pandemic and its implications for infant physical development, thereby providing evidence to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on maternal and child health. Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out involving 450 pregnant women from December 2022 to February 2023. Data included demographic details, PTSD evaluation using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) scale, coping mechanisms, and infant growth indicators at three months postpartum. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to control for confounding factors. Results: The study enrolled a total of 450 pregnant women. Following exclusions and follow-up attrition, 422 pregnant women were analyzed. There were 72 pregnant women with PTSD and 350 without PTSD. There was no statistically significant difference in birth weight between the two groups of participants. Three months after birth, infants of PTSD-positive mothers exhibited significantly lower weight percentiles at three months (P < 0.001), adjusted for birth weight, feeding method, and coping strategies. Multivariate analysis affirmed a 9.44-point reduction in weight percentile among infants in the PTSD-positive group (95% CI: 4.01–14.87, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Pregnant women suffering from PTSD during the pandemic are at risk of giving birth to infants with impaired physical growth. These findings highlight the critical need for mental health support for pregnant women to foster optimal infant development and to guide public health policies and clinical practices.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote care, or telemedicine, in many clinical areas including maternity care. One component of remote care, the use of self-monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy, could form a key component in post-pandemic care pathways. The BUMP trials evaluated a self-monitoring of blood pressure intervention in addition to usual care, testing whether it improved detection or control of hypertension for pregnant people at risk of hypertension or with hypertension during pregnancy. This paper reports the qualitative evaluation which aimed to understand how the intervention worked, the perspectives of participants in the trials, and, crucially, those who declined to participate. Methods: The BUMP trials were conducted between November 2018 and May 2020. Thirty-nine in-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with a diverse sample of pregnant women invited to participate in the BUMP trials across five maternity units in England. Results: Self-monitoring of blood pressure in the BUMP trials was reassuring, acceptable, and convenient and sometimes alerted women to raised BP. While empowering, taking a series of self-monitored readings also introduced uncertainty and new responsibility. Some declined to participate due to a range of concerns. In the intervention arm, the performance of the BUMP intervention may have been impacted by women’s selective or delayed reporting of raised readings and repeated testing in pursuit of normal BP readings. In the usual care arm, more women were already self-monitoring their blood pressure than expected. Conclusions: The BUMP trials did not find that among pregnant individuals at higher risk of preeclampsia, blood pressure self-monitoring with telemonitoring led to significantly earlier clinic-based detection of hypertension nor improved management of blood pressure. The findings from this study help us understand the role that self-monitoring of blood pressure can play in maternity care pathways. As maternity services consider the balance between face-to-face and remote consultations in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, these findings contribute to the evidence base needed to identify optimal, effective, and equitable approaches to self-monitoring of blood pressure.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe complication in the postpartum period and equals a major depression occurring in the first weeks after delivery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased incidence of PPD was observed. For this reason, we conducted an intervention study to test the effectiveness of the “7mind”-app, an app-based mindfulness training program, in the prevention of PPD. Methods: For this purpose, 145 women who gave birth between March and September 2021 were observed up to six months postpartum, with 80 women using the “7mind”-app. The BSF (Berlin Mood Questionnaire) and the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were used to measure depressive symptoms at different time points and were supplemented by questionnaires regarding COVID-related anxieties. Results: The BSF showed a significant improvement over time in the categories “anxiety” (p <.001) and “fatigue” (p <.001). Regarding the EPDS, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups. With a mean EPDS of 7.6 prepartum and 7.4 postpartum, our sample group can be classified as a low-risk collective. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the control and intervention groups with regard to COVID-19-related anxiety. However, a comparison of the correlation analysis of COVID-19-related fears over time showed a clear advantage of the intervention. In particular, fear of the consequences of maternal COVID-19 infection increased significantly in the control group over time (r = 0.98, p = 0.040), while there was no significant change in the intervention group (r = −0.39, p = 0.218). Conclusions: In conclusion, the intervention with the app “7mind” seems to lead to a clear benefit in the prevention of general anxiety and COVID-19-related anxieties, but needs further research to represent a valid intervention for the prevention of PPD.

N2  - Background: The restriction of access to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in self-medication. This study aims to examine mothers’ use of nutrient supplements with over-the-counter (OTC) medications for their children, including instances of self-medication for themselves. The study also explores maternal characteristics associated with this behavior, the specific medications used, and the reasons for use. Method: In this descriptive study, 450 mothers with children aged 2 to 6 years in Türkiye were recruited through social media platforms. Questions focused on whether mothers used supplements for themselves and their children, types of products, frequency, and reasons for use. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to examine the factors associated with OTC medication use for children. Result: Nearly half of the mothers reported administering OTC medications to their children. Factors associated with this practice included the child’s age (specifically 48–72 months), attendance at nursery, perceived underweight status, and regular health visits with a pediatrician. Additionally, mothers who frequently used medications without a doctor’s recommendation were 5.8 times more likely to give OTC drugs to their children. Maternal self-medication was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of OTC medication use for children (OR = 12.1). The most commonly used supplements included vitamin D, fish oil, multivitamins, vitamin C, immune boosters, zinc, probiotics, herbal teas, oral/nasal sprays, throat lozenges, and aspirin, with the primary purposes being prevention and treatment. Conclusions: The administration of OTC medications in young children, who rely heavily on maternal care should be more closely monitored to ensure their safety and well-being, especially during epidemics.

N2  - Background: According to the WHO report and evaluations, Iran has a moderate prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). The present study evaluates Iran’s IDA prevention and control policies by analysing the agenda-setting policy using the multiple streams framework (MSF). Methods: The present study used Kingdon’s MSF model to analyse policies related to IDA in Iran qualitatively. First, the policy documents were reviewed (n = 12), and then in-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders (n = 33) using the framework analysis method. MAXQDA version 2020 was used to categorize the data codes of the interviews and extract related themes. Results: The main factors of the problem stream were the prevalence of IDA among Iranian pregnant women, children and adolescents and its risk factors in Iran. The policy stream focuses on mounting the staff in health centres, preventing non-communicable diseases and parasites in the health system, and promoting health programs, such as supplementation, education and fortification. The current political stream regarding IDA shows that national and international support can provide the right political atmosphere for this issue. There are challenges and obstacles related to implementing these policies in Iran, including the preference for treatment over prevention in the health sector, the existence of many economic problems and the limitation of distribution and access to health services owing to some unforeseen issues, such as sanctions or the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Conclusions: The topic of IDA prevention policymaking has entered a new phase. Responsible organizations, such as the Ministry of Health, should emphasize more in allocating budgets for preventive programs, and key organizations, such as the WHO, should support low- and middle-income countries to empower them towards important preventive strategies.

N2  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient waits for gynaecology appointments increased by 60% in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The aim of this study was to use the electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire-Menstrual, Pain and Hormonal (ePAQ-MPH) electronic patient reported outcome measure (ePROM) to assess symptoms, impact and potential harm for patients waiting > 60 weeks for general gynaecology appointments at a teaching hospital. Methods: 1070 patients waiting > 60 weeks for a new appointment (range 60–72 weeks) were invited to complete ePAQ-MPH online to measure gynaecological symptoms and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). Patients could also call to cancel appointments no longer needed. Non-responders were telephoned weekly for three further weeks and asked to complete ePAQ-MPH. Patients scoring > 80/100 for ePAQ-MPH domains relating to HRQoL had their appointment escalated to be seen within six-eight weeks. Thematic content analysis was undertaken of free-text concerns recorded using ePAQ-MPH. Results: 526 patients completed ePAQ-MPH (49.2%), 169 of these scored greater than 80/100 for one or more HRQoL domains and were seen within 6–8 weeks. 103 patients (9.6%) requested to cancel their appointment. Reasons included problem resolving spontaneously (33%), problem treated by general practitioner (10%) and being seen by a private provider (28%). Commonly recorded free-text concerns related to wanting a diagnosis (n = 142), management of condition (n = 98) and pain management (n = 77). Conclusions: ePAQ-MPH may be used effectively to prioritise patients waiting for an outpatient appointment in gynaecology. Wider use of ePROMs to support waiting list validation within the NHS and elsewhere should be considered.

N2  - Background: Vaccination is one of the most effective measures to prevent influenza illness and its complications. Since the 1980s, countries and territories in the Americas have progressively implemented influenza vaccination operations in high-risk priority groups—such as older adults, pregnant persons, persons with comorbidities and health workers. Methods: In this review, we present the history and progress of the seasonal influenza program in the Americas, how the program contributed to the efficient and timely roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, and how the program can be used to promote immunization operations across the life span for existing and future vaccines. Results: The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2023 underscored the importance of having a robust seasonal influenza vaccination program for pandemic preparedness and response. Overall, countries with existing seasonal influenza vaccination programs were better prepared and rolled out the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and effectively compared to other countries where the influenza vaccination platform was weak or non-existent. Conclusions: Traditionally, national immunization programs of developing countries have been predominately focused on newborns, children younger than five years and school-aged children while often limiting their investment in effective adult vaccination programs; these programs are typically isolated to high-income countries. Countries in Latin America have been the exception, with strong influenza vaccination programs for adults regardless of national income level. The presence of functional and effective adult influenza vaccination programs can also facilitate the acceptance and uptake of other adult vaccines targeting priority groups at higher risk for severe illness or complications.

N2  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant change in the epidemiology of RSV and other viruses occurred worldwide, leading to a reduction in the circulation of these infectious agents. After the pandemic, the resurgence of seasonal respiratory viruses occurred, but some features of these infections contrast to those registered prior to the pandemic. In the present work, we studied 390 children <5 years old admitted to the hospital to determine the contribution of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and influenza viruses to acute respiratory infections during the 2023–2024 winter season in Mexico. RSV was the most frequently detected virus (n = 160, 41%), followed by SARS-CoV-2 (n = 69, 17.7%), hMPV (n = 68, 17.4%), and influenza A or B (n = 40, 10.26%). Fourteen patients required admission to the intensive care unit, including six (42.8%) with RSV infection. Four children died (1%). At least one of the four viruses was detected in all deceased patients: SARS-CoV-2 in one; SARS-CoV-2 and hMPV in two; and RSV, influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 in one. The high impact of RSV and other respiratory viruses indicates the need to implement specific preventive programs to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with them.

N2  - Background: Antenatal mental disorders are associated with maternal and fetal adverse events. Previous studies have been focused on the postpartum period, rather than pregnancy, yet the association of risk factors with prenatal depression and anxiety through pregnancy has been rarely reported. This study aimed to identify the risk factors of prenatal depression and anxiety, and access their potential roles in developing mental disorders during pregnancy. Methods: This is a prospective study in 6470 participants from the Tianjin Birth Cohort in China (TJBC). The degree of prenatal depression and anxiety was evaluated using a questionnaire of Self-Rating Depression scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), which was given to pregnant women at 15–27 (Stage-2), and 28–41 (Stage-3) gestational weeks. The questionnaire also collected demographic, personal, and lifestyle information. The association of different factors with SDS/SAS score was examined by logistic regression analysis. Results: We observed an overall depression rate of 12.4 % and an overall anxiety rate of 7.7 % during pregnancy in the TJBC. In the Stage-2, the depression rate was 14.5 % and the anxiety rate was 9.5 %. In the Stage-3, the depression rate dropped to 9.7 % while the anxiety rate dropped to 5.3 %. With univariate analysis, we found that age, education, social support, marriage satisfaction, secondhand smoke (SHS), sleeping time and stress were common factors of prenatal mental health. Working status, family income, gravidity, smoking, electronic using, recreational activities were associated with depression risk, whereas BMI, disease history, changing eating habits, and feeding animal were associated with anxiety risk. Using logistic regression, we found that low education level, low social support, low marriage satisfaction, thyroid disfunction, Stage-2(second trimester), and stress were related to prenatal mental health. Conclusion: The prevalence anxiety and depression in Tianjin is normal as national level. Age appropriateness, a good education level, sufficient social support, marital satisfaction, normal thyroid function, and absence of stress are associated with relieving depression and anxiety during gestation. However, due to individual difference, expectant mothers should seek professional support and guidance to address their mental health needs during gestation.

N2  - Maternal mental health is a global priority. Like other low-and middle-income countries, maternal mental health issues are highly prevalent in Sri Lanka. While the country claims to have achieved a satisfactory level of maternal health care indicators in the Southeast Asian region, maternal mental health care remains ignored. The COVID-19 pandemic followed by the economic crisis of 2022 has worsened the situation in the country by increasing the prevalence of maternal mental health issues and limiting the availability of and capacity of the country to allocate resources for the healthcare provision for maternal mental health issues. Integrating task-shifted, non-specialist based, mental healthcare into the existing maternal healthcare programme is considered a cost-effective approach in addressing maternal mental health. In this article, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of employing task shifting to address maternal mental health issues in Sri Lanka.

N2  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of ‘ENTREN-F’ –a multi-component, family system-based intervention-for managing paediatric obesity at National Health Primary Care. A 3-arm, parallel-design, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), 165 families were randomized: Arm 1) ENTREN-F(n = 62) is a 12-week cognitive-behavioural intervention (CBT) family system-based programme, addressing lifestyle changes, children's emotional and social development and the family system, Arm 2) ‘ENTREN’ (n = 52) is a CBT family-based programme for children and parents, not addressing the family system, and Arm 3) Control group (CG) (n = 51) covers individual behavioural monitoring. All children were clinical interviewed to assess a diagnosis. Their effectiveness was assessed against six-month changes in children's body mass index (BMI) z-score, children's psychological well-being, levels of expressed maternal emotion, depression symptoms, parental feeding practices, levels of physical activity and sedentary lifestyles. The maintenance of the changes was evaluated for two years. High-attendance rates for ENTREN-F (72.6% vs. 66% vs. 33%, respectively) indicated its greater acceptance. After programme completion, the BMI z-score reduced by .5 points in almost 50% ENTREN-F (n = 22/45), 21.9% ENTREN (n = 7/32) and 11.8% (n = 2/17) CG participants. There were no significant differences between the three trial arms for anthropometric, psychological, or family-related measures. At the two-year follow-up, both ENTREN-F and ENTREN showed similar long-term effectiveness without between-group differences, and weight trajectories were favourable. ENTREN-F appears effective for childhood obesity management; however, the COVID-19 pandemic limited the sample size. Also, the tendency towards multiple differences in child and family outcomes could not be statistically shown. It also provides further evidence of the role of psychological and family-related factors that may underlie the origin and maintenance of weight gain.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can infect various tissues in the body apart from the lungs. Although placental infection remains controversial, COVID-19-associated placental abnormalities have been reported worldwide. Therefore, COVID-19 poses a significant risk for fetal distress as well. Scientists are currently debating whether such distress results from direct viral induced assault or placental damage caused by the mother's immune response. The placenta develops different histopathological lesions in response to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. While some studies support both theories, the transmission rate through the placenta remains low. Therefore, a more in-depth study is necessary to determine the primary cause of maternal SARS-CoV-2-induced fetal distress. This comprehensive review is aimed to shed light on the possible reasons towards fetal distress among mothers with COVID-19. This review describes the various mechanisms of viral entry along with the mechanisms by which the virus could affect the placenta. Reported cases of placental abnormalities and fetal distress symptoms have been collated to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on vertical transmission of COVID-19.

N2  - Liver transplantation (LT) is an established life-saving procedure. The field of LT has changed in the past 10 years from several perspectives, with the expansion of indications, transplantation of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, evolution of transplant oncology, the use of donations after cardiac death, new surgical techniques, and prioritisation of recipients on the waiting list. In addition, the advent of organ perfusion machines, the recognition of new forms of rejection, and the attention paid to the transition from paediatric to adult patients, have all improved the management of LT recipients. The purpose of the EASL guidelines presented here is not to cover all aspects of LT but to focus on developments since the previous EASL guidelines published in 2016.

N2  - Purpose: This study examines the experiences of pregnant/parenting adolescents and young women during the first two years of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This explanatory sequential mixed-methods study leverages quantitative data collected among a cohort of adolescents and young people aged 15–22 years in three Kenyan counties; Nairobi, Kisumu, and Kilifi at three time points (2020, 2021, 2022), and two rounds of qualitative interviews in the same settings conducted in 2020 and 2022. Results: Among 2337 (2020), 1438 (2021), and 1669 (2022) respondents, pregnant/parenting adolescents and youth comprised 140 (6%), 101 (7%), and 83 (5%) individuals, respectively. Across the three time points, the experience of depressive symptoms was similar between pregnant/parenting adolescents and those not pregnant/parenting. Pregnancy and parenting was associated with twice the odds of skipping health services (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43–3.35), in 2020, and 85% higher odds (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14–3.02) in 2021, and 90% higher odds of skipping meals (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.19–3.03) in 2022. Qualitative findings indicated experiences of psychological distress, food insecurity, and inadequate access to health care services among pregnant/parenting young people during the pandemic. Discussion: The pandemic increased pre-existing challenges associated with adolescent and young people's health, predisposing young pregnant/parenting women to greater adversity than their nonpregnant/parenting counterparts. Targeted and responsive approaches during emergencies and crises such as social protection, food security, and mental health programs for this group of vulnerable people are required and need to be integrated into disaster response plans.

N2  - Epidemiologists have long argued that side effects of the stress response include preterm birth. Research reports that fear of lethal infection stressed pregnant persons at the outset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and that “shutdowns” and “social distancing” impeded access to social support and prenatal care. The decline in preterm births in high-income countries, including the United States, during the early months of the pandemic therefore poses a paradox for science. Explanations of this “pandemic preterm paradox” remain untested. We applied time-series modeling to data describing 80 monthly conception cohorts begun in the United States from July 2013 through February 2020 to determine which of 3 explanations most parsimoniously explained the paradox. We infer that “prior loss,” or the argument that an increase in spontaneous abortions and stillbirths depleted the population of fetuses at risk of preterm birth, best explains data currently available. We describe the implications of these results for public health practice.

N2  - COVID-19 triage protocols are resource allocation processes to deal with the potential lack of resources in Intensive Care Units (ICU). They have given rise to numerous ethical issues and controversies. Among them is the fear that people will be denied access to ICU on the basis of judgments about their quality of life, social value, frailty or age. This online Democratic Deliberation (DD) with members of the public aimed to discover the necessary considerations and conditions that make triage protocols more acceptable to guide future decisions in terms of the values and criteria that must underpin triage protocols. We simultaneously conducted the online DD in Quebec and Ontario on May 28th and June 4th, 2022, among adults who do not work in the healthcare sector, recruited randomly among the members of the public registered on Leger Opinion poll website to favor sociodemographic diversity. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Among the participants who took part in the study, 27 participants were from Ontario and 20 from Quebec. Three main themes emerged: 1) Acceptance of the protocol and values, 2) Considerations to be integrated in triage protocols, 3) Conditions which may favor a greater public acceptance of these protocols. Participants supported the idea of prioritizing patients with the best prognosis of survival under extreme conditions. The maximization of benefits was the most predominant approach. Participants considered that triage protocols are necessary to reduce arbitrariness in decision making and to facilitate these tragic decisions by health professionals.

N2  - Objective Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common medical complication of pregnancy that leads to adverse outcomes for both infants and pregnant people. Early detection and treatment can mitigate these negative outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare and laboratory services, including GDM screening programs. Adapted GDM screening guidelines were introduced in many jurisdictions. This study examined changes in uptake, modality, and experiences of GDM screening in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This convergent mixed-method study involved a population-based retrospective cohort analysis of Ontario-based health administrative data to describe and compare gestational diabetes screening rates among 85,228 individuals with live, in-hospital births between January 1-March 31 before (2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2021 and 2022). Descriptive analyses were conducted for GDM screening pathways aligning with usual and pandemic-adapted screening guidance. Qualitative descriptive interviews were conducted about experiences and decision-making of GDM screening with 43 Ontario residents who gave birth between May 2020 and December 2021. Data were integrated during the design and interpretation phases. Results There were small but significant increases in GDM screening during the pandemic; likelihood of screening completion using any modality increased in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2019. Testing modality shifted; the alternate screening strategies introduced during COVID-19 were adopted by clinicians. Interview participants perceived GDM screening to be important and obligatory but accompanied by a degree of stress about potential COVID-19 exposure. Conclusion Despite health system challenges experienced in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic, GDM screening rates increased in the study population, demonstrating the success of adapted GDM screening guidelines. Decisions about screening modalities were driven by clinician expertise, and interview participants were satisfied to provide informed consent to these recommendations.

N2  - Public health restrictions to protect physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic had unintended effects on mental health, which may have disproportionately affected some potentially vulnerable groups. This scoping review of qualitative research provides a narrative synthesis of new mothers' perspectives on their mental health during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions through pregnancy to the postpartum period. Database searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO sought primary research studies published until February 2023, which focused on new mothers' self-perceived mental health during the pandemic (N = 55). Our synthesis found that new mothers' mental health was impacted by general public health restrictions resulting in isolation from family and friends, a lack of community support, and impacts on the immediate family. However, public health restrictions specific to maternal and infant healthcare were most often found to negatively impact maternal mental health, namely, hospital policies prohibiting the presence of birthing partners and in-person care for their infants. This review of qualitative research adds depth to previous reviews that have solely examined the quantitative associations between COVID-19 public health restrictions and new mothers' mental health. Here, our review demonstrates the array of adverse impacts of COVID-19 public health restrictions on new mothers' mental health throughout pregnancy into the postpartum period, as reported by new mothers. These findings may be beneficial for policy makers in future public health emergency planning when evaluating the impacts and unintended consequences of public health restrictions on new mothers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social distancing restrictions and the suspension of in-person treatment and support contributed to an increase in postnatal depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Creative health interventions can help to alleviate anxiety and depression, with studies showing that singing is particularly effective for supporting the mental health of new mothers. We adapted an in-person group singing programme (Breathe Melodies for Mums (M4M)) to online delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic to support the mental health of new mothers, and, in a feasibility study, found improvements in postnatal depression (PND) symptoms at 6-month follow up. The current qualitative study aimed to explore how and why M4M-online impacted the mental health of those taking part. METHODS: We took a theory-based approach using the INgredients iN ArTs in hEealth (INNATE) Framework of 'active ingredients' and the Multi-level Leisure Mechanisms Framework of 'mechanisms of action' to identify and categorise intervention components and change mechanisms. Iterative consensus building between three researchers was complemented by qualitative semi-structured online interviews with 24 women experiencing PND symptoms who took part in M4M-online. Data were analysed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Consistency was found between the online and in-person interventions in active ingredients relating to project design, content, programme management and the composition of the group. Key differences were in the social and contextual ingredients. Psychological, social and behavioural mechanisms for improved mental health and wellbeing included: (1) Increased self-confidence as a mother, (2) Increased positive emotional responses, (3) A supported exploration of self-dentity, (4) Reduced loneliness and isolation, (5) Increased social bonding and connections with family and (6) Enhanced sense of time through new routines. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in online group singing can support new mothers experiencing PND by triggering psychological, social and behavioural responses that lead to improved mental health. Key programme features are identified which can be used to design future online creative health interventions or tailor in-person activities for remote delivery to support populations who may face practical and social barriers to attending in-person.

N2  - Schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric, neurodevelopmental disorder affecting about 0.29-1 % of the global population, is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, cognitive impairments, disorganized thoughts and speech, leading to significant social withdrawal and emotional blunting. During the 1980s, considerations about diseases that result from complex interactions of genetic background and environmental factors started to appear. One of the critical times of vulnerability is the perinatal period. Concerning schizophrenia, obstetric complications that are associated with hypoxia of the fetus or neonate were identified as a risk. Also, maternal infections during pregnancy were linked to schizophrenia by epidemiological, serologic and genetic studies. Research efforts then led to the development of experimental models testing the impact of perinatal hypoxia or maternal immune activation on neurodevelopmental disorders. These perinatal factors are usually studied separately, but given that the models are now validated, it is feasible to investigate both factors together. Inclusion of additional factors, such as metabolic disturbances or chronic stress, may need to be considered also. Understanding the interplay of perinatal factors in schizophrenia's etiology is crucial for developing targeted prevention and therapeutic strategies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is pervasive and can lead to severe health consequences. In the US, 25% of women have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner. However, less is known about the frequency and risk factors for IPV in the obstetric population. STUDY DESIGN: Nested case-control study from a prospective cohort study of 606 parturients at a single academic medical center from 2011-2022. Structured questionnaires were administered randomly chosen, consented patients during their postpartum hospital stay to gather information on social determinants of health (SDoH) and birth outcomes. The case group included participants who reported forced sex causing pregnancy, verbal abuse before or during pregnancy, or physical abuse during pregnancy. The control group reported none of these. Odds ratios were used to quantify the relationship between IPV and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy factors, and levels of perceived support and discrimination. RESULTS: Of 606 study participants, 568 (94%) provided data on IPV. Of those, 20.4% reported IPV (case) and 80.6% reported no IPV (control). 74.6% of the study population was enrolled pre-pandemic. Unmarried status, low income, food insecurity, housing insecurity, substance use during pregnancy, higher gravidity, unintended pregnancy, low social support, and racial and gender discrimination were all significantly associated with IPV; maternal race and pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic were not. CONCLUSIONS: IPV is common, reported by 1 in 5 parturients in our population. Although maternal race was not associated with IPV in this perinatal cohort, experiencing racism was. Initiatives aimed to address SDoH such as substance use, family planning, and access to food and housing remain key opportunities to support pregnant patients experiencing IPV. The connection between perceived discrimination and IPV found here highlight the importance of addressing the influence of racism and gender-based discrimination on adverse birth outcomes in the US.

N2  - The devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the significant threat infectious diseases pose to our society. Pregnancy represents a particularly vulnerable period for infections, which can compromise maternal health and increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Preclinical and clinical investigations suggest a potential association between maternal immune activation (MIA), triggered by viral or bacterial infections, and the increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Genetic and environmental factors might contribute to the overall risk. Hence, the two-hit hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that MIA could act as a first trigger, with subsequent factors, such as stress or drug abuse, exacerbating latent abnormalities. A growing body of research focuses on the interaction between MIA and cannabis use during adolescence, considering the role of the endocannabinoid system in neurodevelopment and in neurodevelopmental disorders. The endocannabinoid system, crucial for fetal brain development, may be disrupted by MIA, leading to adverse outcomes in adulthood. Recent research indicates the endocannabinoid system's significant role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders in preclinical models. However, findings on adolescent cannabinoid exposure in MIA-exposed animals reveal unexpected complexities, with several studies failing to support the exacerbation of MIA-related abnormalities. This review delves into the functional implications of the endocannabinoid system in MIA models, emphasizing 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling's role in synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation, and its relevance to the two-hit model of schizophrenia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding support interventions are associated with longer breastfeeding duration. Contemporary nationally representative data on breastfeeding support as reported by women in England is lacking. Using English national maternity survey data, we describe sources and modes of breastfeeding support as reported by women who gave birth in 2020; sources of support are compared with earlier maternity surveys (2014, 2016, 2018). We also explore the characteristics associated with source/mode of support in 2020 (n = 4,611). METHODS: Women who breastfed were asked about sources of breastfeeding support (midwife; other health professional; other formal breastfeeding support such as breastfeeding specialist, breastfeeding support group, peer supporter; and partner/friend/relative), how this help was given and whether they would have liked more help from a health professional with breastfeeding. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) for the association between sociodemographic and pregnancy-related variables and each source/mode of support were estimated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2020 support from midwives and other health professionals declined (from 84.0% to 64.7%, and 61.6% to 15.5% respectively) whereas other formal breastfeeding support and informal support from partners/friends/relatives remained constant at 27-31% and 34-38% respectively. The proportion of women who wanted more help with breastfeeding increased from 30% in 2014-2018 to 46% in 2020. In 2020, women most likely to want more help with breastfeeding were nulliparous (aRR = 1.64, 95%CI:1.50-1.79), younger (aRR = 1.21, 95%CI:1.03-1.42) and of Pakistani ethnicity (aRR = 1.30, 95%CI:1.06-1.60). Receiving breastfeeding support over the phone (35%) was more common than via video call (13%) or text message (5%); these percentages varied according to socio-demographic and pregnancy-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding support has declined in recent years, and did not meet the needs of many women during the pandemic. Planning for a future emergency should include adequate provision of breastfeeding support particularly if staff are redeployed into other roles. The characteristics associated with support can inform service planning and delivery. Future research should use these factors to develop novel ideas for intervention, such as directly targeting partners or other informal networks with educational or psychosocial interventions.

N2  - Hypertension is one of the most important chronic diseases worldwide. Hypertension is a critical condition encountered frequently in daily life, forming a significant area of service in Primary Health Care (PHC), which healthcare professionals often confront. It serves as a precursor to many critical illnesses and can lead to fatalities if not addressed promptly. Our study underscores the importance of this critical issue by analyzing articles related to hypertension in the PHC research area from the Web of Science Core Collection using bibliometric methods and machine learning techniques, specifically topic analyses using the latent Dirichlet allocation method. The analysis was conducted using Python Scikit-learn, Gensim, and Wordcloud Libraries, the VosViewer program, and the Bibliometrix R Biblioshiny library. Our findings revealed a steady increase in publication output in hypertension-related research. Analysis shows that hypertension-related research in the PHC research area is clustered into 8 groups: (1) management of hypertension in PHC, risk factors, and complications; (2) psychiatric disorders and hypertension; (3) pediatric and pregnancy hypertension; (4) environmental factors and living conditions; (5) sex and age effects on hypertension; (6) COVID-19 and hypertension; (7) behavioral risk factors, quality of life, and awareness; and (8) current treatment methods and guidelines. Research on hypertension has focused intensively on kidney disease, obesity, pregnancy, cardiovascular risk, heart disease, calcium channel blockers, body mass index, amlodipine, mortality, risk factors, hyperlipidemia, depression, and resistant hypertension. This study represents the first and comprehensive bibliometric analysis of hypertension in the PHC research area. Annual publication volumes have steadily increased over the years. In recent years, topics such as social determinants, patient attendance, self-management, diabetes mellitus, COVID-19, telemedicine, type 2 diabetes, and noncommunicable diseases have garnered significant interest in the field of PHC services.

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had substantially disrupted maternal health care provision and utilisation in Bangladesh. However, the extent of geographical disparities in service utilisation and how the health system withstood these challenges have not been studied. This study explores the divisional disparities in trends and disruptions in maternal health service utilisation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data was extracted from the District Health Information Software of Bangladesh from January 2017 to December 2021. We assessed the trend of first antenatal care visit, institutional delivery and number of caesarean sections over these years. We explored both the yearly and monthly trends to see the variations in the number of utilisations. Segmented regression with Poisson distribution was used to assess changes in service utilisation during the COVID-19 period. We reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) of service utilisation with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in different divisions during COVID-19 (2020-2021) compared to the reference period (2017-2019). Results: Initially, a notable decline in maternal health care utilisation was observed in 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic period of 2017-2019. Divisional disparities were observed in this trend. Overall, compared to the pre-pandemic period, we observed around 30% decline in all three selected indicators of maternal health care. The lowest value was observed in Chattogram in 2020 (IRR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.55-0.79) and Rajshahi in 2021 (IRR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.60-0.82). For institutional delivery, Barishal division had the lowest IRR (0.64; 95% CI = 0.60-0.68) in 2020 and, in 2021 Rajshahi had the lowest IRR (0.71; 95% CI = 0.60-0.82). For caesarean section, the lowest value was observed in Barishal division (IRR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.44-0.53) in 2020 and in Mymensingh (IRR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.32-0.43) in 2021. By 2021, the three maternal health care utilisation indicators demonstrated recovery. Conclusions: The effect of the pandemic, including lockdown, on the selected maternal service utilisation was observed in Bangladesh though there were substantial geographic disparities. These disruptions slightly recovered after the initial shock. These results will support the government in preparing the national and regional health systems for future epidemics in Bangladesh.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Stressful large-scale events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters, impact birthing individuals' postpartum experiences and their mental health. Resultant changes in government assistance, housing, and employment may further exacerbate these impacts, with differences experienced by varying income levels and races. This study aimed to examine maternal depression and anxiety in postpartum individuals by income and race during a stressful large-scale event, and the mediating role of government assistance, housing, and employment. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study was conducted (QUANT + QUAL). For aim 1 (quantitative), birthing individuals who delivered during peak pandemic (June 2020 - September 2021) completed questionnaires related to their perinatal experiences and mental health. Macrosystem factors (government assistance, housing, and employment changes) were assessed using the Psychosocial Recommended Measures. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) assessed depression and anxiety, respectively. Serial linear regression models assessed the relationship between race and income with mental health and macrosystem factors. For aim 2 (qualitative), 40 individuals from the quantitative study balanced by income (low vs. high income) and race (Black vs. White) completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews which were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Amongst 1582 birthing individuals, Black individuals had a significantly higher EPDS score compared to White counterparts. Not receiving government assistance, unstable housing, and experiencing various employment changes were all related to worse mental health during stressful large-scale events. In semi-structured interviews, low-income individuals discussed that government assistance helped alleviate a financial and mental burden. Low- and high-income individuals reported varying job changes that impacted their mental health (low-income: job loss, high-income: increased hours). CONCLUSIONS: This research spotlights the negative impact of large-scale events most affected both Black and low-income individuals' postpartum mental health, and the role of government assistance, stable housing, and secure employment in helping to alleviate these disparities between income levels.

N2  - Introduction: This consensus statement recommends eight high-level trackable policy actions most likely to significantly improve health and wellbeing for children and young people by 2030. These policy actions include an overarching policy action and span seven interconnected domains that need to be adequately resourced for every young person to thrive: Material basics; Valued, loved and safe; Positive sense of identity and culture; Learning and employment pathways; Healthy; Participating; and Environments and sustainable futures. Main recommendations: Provide financial support to invest in families with young children and address poverty and material deprivation in the first 2000 days of life. Establish a national investment fund to provide sustained, culturally relevant, maternal and child health and development home visiting services for the first 2000 days of life for all children facing structural disadvantage and/or adversity. Implement a dedicated funding model for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled early years services across the country to ensure these services are fully resourced to provide quality early learning and integrated services grounded in culture and community. Properly fund public schools, starting by providing full and accountable Schooling Resource Standard funding for all schools, with immediate effect for schools in communities facing structural disadvantage. Establish legislation and regulation to protect children and young people aged under 18 years from the marketing of unhealthy and harmful products. Amend the electoral act to extend the compulsory voting age to 16 years. Legislate an immediate end to all new fossil fuel projects in Australia. Establish a federal Future Generations Commission with legislated powers to protect the interests of future generations. Changes in approach as a result of this statement: Together, these achievable evidence-based policies would significantly improve children and young people's health and wellbeing by 2030, build a strong foundation for future generations, and provide co-benefits for all generations and society.

N2  - Amid the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cambodia emerges as a notable exemplar, boasting a remarkable vaccination rate of 91% of its population by the end of 2021. This success can be attributed to a multifaceted approach encompassing strong governmental leadership, robust vaccine management, and effective risk communication. Despite notable success, challenges persisted in reaching unvaccinated segments of the population. Rapid Coverage and Community assessments (RCCAs) supported by UNICEF were deployed in 2022 and 2023 to support Government efforts in expanding vaccination reach to missed populations and bolster COVID-19 booster doses. RCCAs were conducted across 8 provinces, assessing 13,547 individuals from 87 low-coverage communes to identify not vaccinated people and understand their barriers. Overall, only seven percent missed any dose of C-19 vaccine, Disabilities and lack of education correlated with higher rates of zero doses (20.8% and 17.8%, respectively), with concerns about personal health conditions (25%) and adverse effects (10%) cited as top reasons for non-vaccination. RCCAs, differing from routine monitoring, utilized purposive sampling to identify barriers to vaccine access and uptake. Findings informed adaptive strategies by government and partners to enhance outreach in low-coverage areas. The RCCAs played a crucial role at the local level in ensuring vaccinations reached overlooked populations, providing innovative solutions and supporting UNICEF's national strategies. By the end of 2022, Cambodia achieved a high subnational coverage, contributing to a national coverage of 95% for primary doses and nearly 70% for the first booster for everyone above three years old. RCCAs also fostered local coordination, facilitating resource sharing, and coordinated action for more effective local outreach and community trust. Integration of RCCAs into national immunization programs is recommended to develop targeted outreach for underserved populations, including zero-dose children and communities. Cambodia's adaptation of RCCAs during the pandemic offers valuable insights into identifying and engaging missed populations, highlighting the importance of community involvement and targeted interventions for future pandemic preparedness, and achieving more equitable health outcomes in the longer-term.

N2  - The National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) of Kenya was upgraded to improve access to healthcare for impoverished households, expand universal health coverage, and boost the uptake of essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services. However, premiums may be unaffordable for the poorest households. The Innovative Partnership for Universal Sustainable Healthcare (i-PUSH) programme targets low-income women and their households to improve their access to and utilization of quality healthcare, including RMNCH services, by providing subsidized, mobile phone-based NHIF coverage in combination with enhanced, digital training of community health volunteers and upgrading of health facilities. This study evaluated whether expanded NHIF coverage increased the accessibility and utilization of quality basic RMNCH services in areas where i-PUSH was implemented using a longitudinal cluster randomized controlled trial in Kakamega, Kenya. A total of 24 pair-matched villages were randomly assigned either to the treatment or the control group. Within each village, 10 eligible households (i.e. with a woman aged 15-49 years who was either pregnant or with a child <4 years old) were randomly selected. The study applied a difference-in-difference methodology based on a pooled cross-sectional analysis of baseline, midline and endline data, with robustness checks based on balanced panels and Analysis of Covariance methods. The analysis sample included 346 women, of whom 248 had had a live birth in the 3 years prior to any of the surveys, and 424 children aged 0-59 months. Improved NHIF coverage did not have a statistically significant impact on any of the RMNCH outcome indicators at midline nor endline. Uptake of RMNCH services, however, improved substantially in both control and treatment areas at endline compared to baseline. For instance, significant increases were observed in the number of antenatal care visits from baseline to midline (mean = 2.62-2.92, P < 0.01) and delivery with a skilled birth attendant from baseline to midline (mean = 0.91-0.97, P < 0.01). Expanded NHIF coverage, providing enhanced access to RMNCH services of unlimited duration at both public and private facilities, did not result in an increased uptake of care, in a context where access to basic public RMNCH services was already widespread. However, the positive overall trend in RMNCH utilization indicators, in a period of constrained access due to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that the other components of the i-PUSH programme may have been beneficial. Further research is needed to better understand how the provision of insurance, enhanced community health volunteer training and improved healthcare quality interact to ensure pregnant women and young children can make full use of the continuum of care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant and parenting youth in Canada face multiple challenges in fulfilling their parenting responsibilities while meeting their own unique needs. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health restrictions exacerbated their challenges by reducing access to support networks, limiting opportunities to promote growth and well-being, and destabilizing their financial and economic standing. The impacts of the pandemic on the mental, physical, and emotional health of individuals are well-documented in the literature. However, there is limited research on how the pandemic influenced the lives, health, and well-being of pregnant and parenting youth and their children in Canada. Therefore, we aimed to examine the wider impacts (social and structural determinants that directly or indirectly impact health and well-being) of the pandemic and its implications for this population. METHODS: We used a constructivist grounded theory approach to explore the experiences of pregnant and parenting youth during the pandemic and how certain social determinants of health intersected to shape health outcomes and influence their ability to access services. We conducted qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide over Zoom. Using grounded theory principles, we inductively analyzed the data and categorized our findings into themes. RESULTS: We recruited a total of 50 participants from different regions in Canada. The findings from the interviews were categorized into the following themes: (1) "They bear the burden alone": Struggles of pregnant and parenting youth, (2) "How will I live the next day?": Concerns and consequences arising from the pandemic, and (3) "Try to keep your mask on": Navigating healthcare services while maintaining public health guidelines. Our findings highlight the various challenges encountered by the youth during the pandemic, particularly those associated with financial and economic constraints, lack of accessible health and social services, and increased stress from parenting responsibilities. CONCLUSION: Pregnant and parenting youth in Canada encountered various barriers while accessing health and social services, maintaining their well-being, and connecting with reliable sources of support during the pandemic. Our study findings emphasize the urgent need for adaptable and comprehensive support systems explicitly catering to the needs of pregnant and parenting youth during crises, such as the pandemic.

N2  - Background: In an evolving landscape of practices and policies, reviewing and incorporating the latest scientific evidence is necessary to ensure optimal clinical management for people with opioid use disorder. We provide a synopsis of the 2024 update of the 2018 National Guideline for the Clinical Management of Opioid Use Disorder, from the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Matters. Methods: For this update, we followed the United States Institute of Medicine’s Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines and used the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation—Recommendation Excellence tool to ensure guideline quality. We carried out a comprehensive systematic literature review, capturing the relevant literature from Jan. 1, 2017, to Sept. 14, 2023. We drafted and graded recommendations according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation approach. A multidisciplinary external national committee, which included people with living or lived experience of opioid use disorder, provided input that was incorporated into the guideline. Recommendations: From the initial 11 recommendations in the 2018 guideline, 3 remained unchanged, and 8 were updated. Specifically, 4 recommendations were consolidated into a single revised recommendation; 1 recommendation was split into 2; another recommendation was moved to become a special consideration; and 2 recommendations were revised. Key changes have arisen from substantial evidence supporting that methadone and buprenorphine are similarly effective, particularly in reducing opioid use and adverse events, and both are now considered preferred first-line treatment options. Slow-release oral morphine is recommended as a second-line option. Psychosocial interventions can be offered as adjunctive treatment but should not be mandatory. The guideline reaffirms the importance of avoiding withdrawal management as a standalone intervention and of incorporating evidence-based harm reduction services along the continuum of care. Interpretation: This guideline update presents new recommendations based on the latest literature for standardized management of opioid use disorder. The aim is to establish a robust foundation upon which provincial and territorial bodies can develop guidance for optimal care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control measures presented impediments for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programming in Uganda. Nationwide control measures implemented April-June 2020 included a public transport ban and mandatory travel permits for pregnant women to access clinics. Program adaptations instituted for continuity of services included community drug delivery and home-based DNA-PCR testing for HIV-exposed infants (HEI). We examined the effect of COVID-19 control measures and program adaptations on PMTCT service uptake in central Uganda. METHODS: We analysed data for pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV) and HEI receiving PMTCT services in eight districts in central Uganda. We abstracted data from medical records at 96 public clinics for six months pre-lockdown (October 2019-March 2020), three months of lockdown (April-June 2020), and six months post-lockdown (July-December 2020). We measured monthly antiretroviral therapy (ART) refill attendance, health facility deliveries, and timely DNA-PCR testing of HEI for HIV (within two months of birth). We conducted segmented ordinary least squares regression of interrupted time series and adjusted for month-to-month changes using Cumby-Huizinga test. We reported results using coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: At the start of pre-lockdown (October 2019), there were 448 deliveries, 2,676 ART refills and 556 timely HEI tests. The pre-lockdown trend for ART refills increased while deliveries and HEI tests declined. At the start of lockdown (April 2020), all indicators declined, although significantly for facility deliveries (-60; 95% CI: -102, -18). Lockdown monthly trends were positive with 68 more HEI tested per month (95% CI:42, 93) and 51 more deliveries (95% CI: 9, 94) but insignificantly negative for ART refills. At start of post-lockdown (July 2020), HEI testing declined (-28; 95%CI: -48, -8). Post-lockdown HEI testing trend was negative with 70 fewer HEI tested per month (95%CI: -79, -62) while no difference in trend for deliveries and ART refills. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 control measures had a significant immediate negative impact on pregnancy deliveries at health facilities. During lockdown, all service rates rapidly recovered through program adaptations, significantly for HEI testing and deliveries. Maintaining these adaptations might help restore the positive trend in timely HIV testing for HEI.

N2  - Objective/Background: Unmet needs in perinatal mental healthcare are an important public health issue particularly in the context of a stressful life event such as the COVID-19 pandemic but data on the extent of this problem are needed. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the (1) proportion of women with clinically significant symptoms of perinatal depression, anxiety or comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety, receiving mental healthcare overall and by country and (2) factors associated with receiving mental healthcare. Method: Women in the perinatal period (pregnancy or up to 6 months postpartum) participating in the Riseup-PPD-COVID-19 cross-sectional study, reported on sociodemographic, social support health-related factors, and COVID-19 related factors, and on symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7]) using self-report questionnaires. Clinically significant symptoms were defined as EPDS ≥ 13 for depression and GAD-7 ≥ 10 for anxiety. Mental healthcare was defined as self-reported current mental health treatment. Results: Of the 11 809 participants from 12 countries included in the analysis, 4 379 (37.1%) reported clinically significant symptoms of depression (n = 1 228; 10.4%; EPDS ≥ 13 and GAD-7 10), anxiety (n = 848; 7.2%; GAD-7 ≥ 10 and EPDS 13) or comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety (n = 2 303; 19.5%; EPDS ≥ 13 and GAD-7 ≥ 10). Most women with clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety were not receiving mental healthcare (89.0%). Variation in the proportion of women with clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety reporting mental healthcare was high (4.7% in Turkey to 21.6% in Brazil). Women in the postpartum (vs. pregnancy) were less likely (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.88), whereas women with previous mental health problems (vs. no previous mental health problems) (OR 5.56; 95% CI 4.41-7.01), were more likely to receive mental healthcare. Conclusion: There are high unmet needs in mental healthcare for women with clinically significant symptoms of perinatal depression and/or anxiety across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and covering the whole range of mental health problems in the perinatal period are warranted to understand the gaps in perinatal mental healthcare.

N2  - To date, the effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) discontinued before 4 weeks has not been analysed in routine clinical practice. The study aimed to determine whether such a short therapy will enable achieving a sustained virological response under real-world experience. The study population of 97 patients who discontinued DAA therapy and had data enabling analysis of patient and disease characteristics, and assessment of treatment effectiveness was selected from 16,815 patients registered in the EpiTer-2 database. The most common reason for discontinuation was hepatic decompensation (20.6%) or the patient's personal decision (18.6%). Patients who discontinued treatment were significantly older, more frequently therapy-experienced, more likely to have cirrhosis, a history of decompensation and a Child–Pugh B or C classification than those who completed treatment. SVR was achieved by 93.5% of patients who discontinued treatment after 4 weeks, 60.9% if discontinued at 3 or 4 week and 33.3% at Week 1 or 2. Patients receiving pangenotypic but not genotype-specific treatment who discontinued after 4 weeks were as likely to achieve SVR as those who completed therapy. Patients who responded to treatment that lasted no longer than 2 weeks had a low baseline viral load (<400,000 IU/mL). Despite discontinuation of therapy after Week 4, the chances of SVR are high. Very early discontinuation does not preclude therapeutic success, especially in patients with low baseline viral load.

N2  - To explore clients’ and clinicians’ perspectives about the acceptability and perceived outcomes of the Sustaining New South Wales (NSW) Families (SNF) program shifted to a hybrid service delivery model during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed methods design comprising cross-sectional online surveys and a focus group. Eighty clients who accessed the SNF service and 12 SNF clinicians. Anonymous client survey comprising questions about perceived benefits and impacts of the hybrid SNF program model, and suggestions for change. Clinician focus group discussion about perceived benefits and challenges of the hybrid SNF model. The hybrid SNF program is a child and family health nursing home visitation program for families with moderate level psychosocial risks. It comprises a mix of face-to-face and virtual telehealth/telephone appointments, delivered during pregnancy and up to 2 years postpartum. Clients reported high levels of satisfaction with the program, and improvements in confidence and decision-making. Clinicians spoke of increased efficiency and flexibility, and capacity for ongoing service provision during the COVID-19 period. Technology access issues were identified as a barrier. Overall, however, both clients and clinicians expressed a preference for face-to-face SNF service provision. While further studies are required to test clinical outcomes, the hybrid SNF model is acceptable to clients and clinicians.

Methods: A single-site retrospective cohort study of 425 patients who sought POC consultation from 2018–2022 before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The mean age of patients at consultation was 35.2 ± 4.0. 73% (n = 310) of the new consultations occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic. 335 patients completed fertility assessment following consultation. Of the 335 patients (78.8%) completing fertility assessment, 139 (32.7%) underwent at least one cycle. The odds of completing fertility assessment were 3.65 times greater for patients being seen pre-pandemic than for those being seen during the pandemic (p < 0.001). Not having a committed partner (OR 2.61, p < 0.001) and not having a prior pregnancy history (OR 1.99, p = 0.03) positively predicted POC uptake. Each additional number of cryopreserved MII oocytes in the first cycle reduced the odds of undergoing more cycles by 0.74 times (p < 0.001). Of the 196 patients with no POC uptake despite having a fertility consultation, 10 decided to do nothing, 16 decided to get pregnant with or without a partner, and the other 170 had not yet indicated their decision. Conclusion: Our centre experienced a surge of patients seeking POC consultation since the COVID-19 outbreak. Approximately one-third of these patients progressed to the POC stage. Our findings validate the complexity of POC decision-making and the value of providing ongoing decision support to patients along the POC pathway.

N2  - Objective: Describe the current status of illness perception, depression, and self-management behaviors among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore the role of depression in the relationship between illness perception and self-management behaviors among women with GDM. Methods: Pregnant women diagnosed with GDM were recruited at the obstetrics clinic of a Grade-A tertiary hospital in Wuhan, through convenience sampling. Self-reported questionnaires including basic information, illness perception, depression, and self-management behaviors were used to collect data from April 2021 to February 2022. Mediation analysis was performed by SPSS Process macro. Results: Among GDM pregnant women, the mean self-management behaviors score was 73.89 (SD = 12.21), the mean illness perception score was 31.80 (SD = 8.77), and 44.3% had depression scores of 10 or higher. The indirect effect of illness perception on self-management behaviors mediated by depression was significant (path a * b, β = −0.045), accounting for 26.6% of the total effect. Conclusion: GDM pregnant women have a certain negative illness perception of GDM, and the detection rate of depression symptoms is relatively high. The level of self-management behaviors among GDM pregnant women is notably suboptimal and warrants improvement. Depression partially mediates the relationship between illness perception and self-management behaviors. Improving positive illness perception and decreasing depression are important strategies to improve self-management behaviors in women with GDM.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the main psychosocial motivational factors behind the increased adoption of IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This prospective, multicenter, observational case–control study assessed the factors motivating infertile couples to pursue their first IVF treatment during the pandemic across various IVF clinics in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the USA, and Panama. A pre-pandemic control group and a post-pandemic participant group were surveyed. The study was conducted between November 2021 and January 2023. The increase in IVF cycles was analyzed, and an ad hoc survey was developed to explore the motivational factors driving IVF engagement. Results: Most clinics reported a significant increase in IVF demand (5.5–8.7%) for all indicators, including the number of started ovarian stimulations, oocyte pickups, and embryo transfers, following the declaration of the pandemic. The extra time spent and the reduced workload were the most important motivations prompting women to pursue their first fertility treatment during the pandemic (time to spend in the couple’s relationship—OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06–2.20; p < 0.05; decreased workload—OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.11–6.24; p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study highlights that infertility remains a significant stressor for individuals, and the desire to resolve it is not hindered by catastrophic events like COVID-19. Open communication between partners about reproductive intentions, combined with reduced work-related stress, is a key factor influencing the initiation of fertility treatment. It is crucial to encourage couples to take timely action in facing infertility.

N2  - The use of telehealth prenatal care increased exponentially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but there is no literature describing its use for group prenatal care during this time. The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated structural barriers to care that disproportionately affect Black and Latinx people. Telehealth enabled pregnant people to access health care and minimize infectious risks. Telehealth group prenatal care (T-GPNC) incorporated the essential elements of CenteringPregnancy with telehealth is an innovative care delivery method borne out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic that has potential to mitigate structural barriers to care. Mary's Center is a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Washington, DC, and Maryland that rapidly pivoted to individual telehealth prenatal care early in the pandemic. Mary's Center used our experience with group care and guidance from the Centering Healthcare Institute on virtual Centering to launch T-GPNC. This new model included home self-monitoring equipment and video classrooms, mixed with in-person individual care visits. We used a team-based approach with nurses, midwives, and community health workers to provide holistic care to pregnant people. Our robust care coordination team also connected them to home visiting, mental health services, and nutrition counseling. The purpose of this article is to describe how Mary's Center modified the CenteringPregnancy model of group prenatal care for telehealth, following the hallmarks of CenteringPregnancy, and met the needs of Spanish-speaking clients, henceforth Latinx clients. A secondary purpose is to demonstrate how telehealth can expand access to health care and remove structural barriers that may prevent pregnant people from attending in-person appointments. We also discuss the structural inequities in digital access and literacy in the context of program implementation.

N2  - Pregnancy is a vulnerable period of time during which pregnant people are prone to infections like COVID-19, which can increase risks for both the mother and fetus. These infections may lead to complications such as preterm birth, developmental delays, and congenital abnormalities. While COVID-19 poses additional risks like placental dysfunction and neonatal infections, studies on long-term effects remain limited. Ongoing research and monitoring are essential to understand and mitigate potential cognitive and developmental challenges in children born to mothers infected with COVID-19. This review aims to guide clinicians in managing these risks throughout childhood. Maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can have significant implications for fetal development, even if the newborn is not infected at birth. The release of inflammatory cytokines may cross the placental barrier, potentially disrupting fetal brain development and increasing the risk of long-term cognitive and behavioral issues, such as ADHD or autism. Placental dysfunction, caused by inflammation or thrombosis, can lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, or hypoxia, affecting both neurological and respiratory health in newborns. Furthermore, a compromised fetal immune system can increase susceptibility to autoimmune conditions and infections. The early diagnosis and management of infections during pregnancy are crucial in mitigating risks to both the mother and fetus. Swift intervention can prevent complications like preterm birth and long-term developmental challenges, ensuring better health outcomes for both the mother and child. Long-term monitoring of children born to mothers infected with COVID-19 is necessary to understand the full extent of the virus’s impact. This review evaluates the long-term systemic effects of maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy on fetuses, newborns, and children, focusing beyond vertical transmission. It highlights the broader impacts on fetal development, offering insights to help clinicians manage potential issues that may arise later in life.

N2  - Background: The risk of depression during pregnancy and postpartum is high and has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of depressive disorders and self-harm thoughts in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first week postpartum in the pandemic period. Methods: This study involved a total of 317 pregnant and postpartum women. The risk and severity of depressive disorders and the prevalence of self-harm thoughts in women during the perinatal period were assessed using EPDS. Results: Pregnant women were significantly more likely to have higher EPDS scores compared to postpartum women. Mild depressive symptoms were reported by 22.08% of pregnant women and 17.18% of postpartum women, and severe symptoms were observed in 25.97% of pregnant women and 16.56% of postpartum women. Thoughts of self-harm were reported by 11.69% of pregnant women and 17.79% of postpartum women. Self-harm thoughts were significantly more common among pregnant women: multiparous women, pregnant women who received psychiatric treatment before pregnancy, those diagnosed with depressive disorders, those who suffered from prolonged periods of anxiety and sadness, and those lacking a supportive person. Among postpartum women, there were statistically significant differences in the prevalence of self-harm thoughts for place of residence, education, type of occupation, number of pregnancies, course of pregnancy, and presence of a supportive person. Conclusions: The increased prevalence of depressive symptoms and self-harm thoughts related to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for screening among pregnant women and the implementation of clinical interventions.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant challenges for healthcare providers working with pregnant and parenting youth. However, the impacts of the pandemic on this population and healthcare services from the perspective of healthcare providers are not well documented in Canada. We examined the narratives and experiences of healthcare providers regarding these impacts and explored the challenges to service provision. Using a qualitative interpretative description (ID) approach, we recruited 25 health and service providers from Alberta, Ontario, and British Columbia for individual qualitative interviews. Our analysis resulted in three themes: complexities of health service provision during COVID-19, healthcare providers’ accounts of impacts on pregnant and parenting youth, and leveraging challenges into opportunities for service provision. Participants described the influence of pandemic policies and distancing measures on accessibility of health services, availability of healthcare resources and personnel, and well-being of their clients. They also reported increased mental health issues, isolation, and exacerbation of inequities within this population. Providers highlighted the role of telemedicine in ensuring some degree of continuity of care. Additionally, they commented on service adaptations to address the evolving needs of their clients. Our findings underline the need for a resilient and adaptable healthcare system that can better support the needs of vulnerable populations during crises.

N2  - Indigenous communities in the United States (U.S.) have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, yet they have led efforts to combat the pandemic by providing local solutions that minimize viral transmission and promote vaccine uptake. Understanding facilitators and barriers to recommended behaviors can increase adherence and reduce COVID-19 transmission. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 19 Indigenous adults residing on Tribal Lands in the Southwest U.S. between June and December 2021. Interview questions explored obstacles and motivators to testing, as well as behavioral recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission and increase vaccination. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, we identified barriers and facilitators to behavioral change. Barriers to testing included fear of exposure to COVID-19 at testing locations and discomfort from nasal swabs. Facilitators of testing were access, required testing, and protecting loved ones. Barriers to vaccination were discouraging stories about vaccination side effects and uncertainty about the ingredients and effectiveness of vaccines. Another barrier to vaccination was confusion and fairness related to vaccine eligibility, which discouraged some people from becoming vaccinated, despite intentions to do so. This study identified obstacles and motivators influencing COVID-19 testing and vaccination. The results may help address information gaps and improve public health efforts to reduce COVID-19 transmission and other similar infectious agents in Indigenous communities.

N2  - Objectives: To understand how the perinatal care experiences among adolescents were impacted during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: Integrative review. Methods: We performed a search in the literature focusing on qualitative studies regarding the perceptions of pregnant adolescents during the pandemic (2020–2023). We described the most frequent thematic axes observed in the included studies, and we synthesized the results. Results: The selection involved 69 articles, resulting in 9 studies from 7 countries (Indonesia, Kenya, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States, Malawi, and India). The studies highlight six main thematic axes: 1. Economic impact: the pandemic adversely influenced personal and family conditions, leading to early marriages and violence and exacerbating pre-existing economic inequalities. 2. Mental health: increased anxiety, depression, isolation, and fear among pregnant adolescents, with a focus on concerns related to contamination and perinatal uncertainties. 3. Compromised perinatal care: restrictions during prenatal and delivery care and lack of emotional and professional support lead to negative impacts on care for pregnant adolescents. 4. Breakdown of family Support network: school closures, family losses, and increased domestic violence affected family dynamics, influencing the occurrence of early pregnancies. 5. Impact on sexual education: school closures hindered access to contraceptives, contributing to unplanned pregnancies. 6. Vaccine hesitancy: misinformation led to hesitancy among pregnant women, highlighting the need for better communication to increase confidence in vaccination. Conclusions: The review emphasizes the wide geographic variety of the studies and highlights the interconnection between economic, social, and mental health factors. The pandemic intensified preexisting challenges, underscoring the importance of comprehensive support for pregnant adolescents, including emotional and psychological support. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated social and economic inequalities, negatively impacting the perinatal experiences of pregnant adolescents. The emphasis is on the need for comprehensive support, considering psychosocial factors, highlights the importance of more inclusive and sensitive health policies addressing the specific needs of this group during public health crises. The identified thematic axes, spanning economic, mental health, perinatal care, family support networks, sexual education, and vaccine hesitancy, illuminate the intricate challenges faced by adolescents during the pandemic. The identification of these axes provided a comprehensive analysis of the diverse consequences experienced by adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also allows the proposition of tailored interventions to mitigate the adverse effects on adolescent well-being and inform public health strategies for future pandemics or crises.

N2  - Objective: To identify published research on the Shock Index (SI) in patients with septic shock or severe sepsis and to describe its main findings and conclusions. Design: Systematic review of the literature following the recommendations of the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Settings: The following databases were consulted: Pubmed, Embase, Library Cochrane and Lilacs. Patients: Patients older than 14 years with septic shock. Pregnant women and population with COVID-19 were excluded. Interventions: Studies reporting measurement of the shock index or its modified variants. Main variables of interest: Absolute frequencies and relative frequencies were assessed with measures of central tendency and dispersion. Effect estimators (OR, RR and HR) were extracted according to the context of each study. Results: Seventeen articles were included, of which 11 investigated the SI as a predictor of mortality. Seven of them found significant differences in the SI when comparing survivors to non-survivors and observed a relationship between the SI evolution and clinical outcomes. Additional research evidenced a relation between the Modified Shock Index and myocardial depression, as well as mortality. Furthermore, they identified a relationship between the Diastolic Shock Index, the dose of administered dobutamine, and mortality. Conclusions: The results suggest that both the SI and its modified versions, particularly in serial assessments, can be considered for evaluating patient prognosis. The SI can also aid in determining fluid management for patients.

N2  - The mental health burden in India is increasing at unprecedented rates. The increased demand for mental health care and the undersupply of services has widened the treatment gap. Due to several factors, such as increasing service costs and the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, India has witnessed an inclination toward using digital mental health solutions to overcome the treatment gap. Drawing from the collective evidence and experience in implementing mental health solutions using digital phenotyping and smartphone app-based care delivery in India, we define the scope, potential, and challenges of implementing synchronous and asynchronous digital mental health solutions that can serve as a template for improving global mental health.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this longitudinal, qualitative study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-efficacy and diabetes management among youth diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: We conducted two semi-structured interviews with adolescents diagnosed with T1DM (n = 18) and their maternal caregivers (n = 20) over 6–9 months, to understand how their confidence in the adolescent's ability to manage their diabetes changed during the pandemic. Interviews were transcribed and coded by four raters, establishing inter-reliability. Results: Four themes emerged: Preventing Adverse Glycemic Events, Useful Glucose Trend Information, Improved Diabetes Management, and Downsides of Technology. Most adolescents (63%) reported increased confidence in their ability to manage diabetes during the pandemic. Over half of these adolescents were already using an insulin pump, and a substantial number (33%) updated their insulin delivery method. Both adolescents and caregivers cited diabetes devices as a factor in their self-efficacy for diabetes management. Discussion: Findings illustrate the importance of diabetes management in the daily lives of adolescents diagnosed with T1DM, and the potential benefits of diabetes devices during disruptions to care.

N2  - COVID-19 vaccine research has played a vital role in successfully controlling the pandemic, and the research surrounding the coronavirus vaccine is ever-evolving and accruing. These enormous efforts in knowledge production necessitate a structured analysis as secondary research to extract useful insights. In this study, comprehensive analytics was performed to extract these insights, which has moved the boundaries of data analytics in secondary research in the vaccine field by utilizing topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and topic classification based on the abstracts of related publications indexed in Scopus and PubMed. By applying topic modeling to 4803 abstracts filtered by this study criterion, 8 research arenas were identified by merging related topics. The extracted research areas were entitled “Reporting,” “Acceptance,” “Reaction,” “Surveyed Opinions,” “Pregnancy,” “Titer of Variants,” “Categorized Surveys,” and “International Approaches.” Moreover, the investigation of topics sentiments variations over time led to identifying researchers' attitudes and focus in various years from 2020 to 2022. Finally, a CNN-LSTM classification model was developed to predict the dominant topics and sentiments of new documents based on the 25 pre-determined topics with 75 % accuracy. The findings of this study can be utilized for future research design in this area by quickly grasping the structure of the current research on the COVID-19 vaccine. Through the findings of current research, a classification model was developed to classify the topic of a new article as one of the identified topics. Also, vaccine manufacturing firms will achieve a niche market by having a schema to invest in the gap of fields that have yet to be concentrated in extracted topics.

N2  - Problem: Women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic may be at risk of elevated postpartum mental health problems. Background: Social support protects maternal mental health during a pandemic. It is possible that formal supports, such as continuity maternity models of care, may also support maternal wellbeing. Aim: To investigate whether model of care moderates the association between prenatal maternal stress from the COVID-19 pandemic, and postpartum (a) depression and (b) anxiety. Methods: Women in Australia, pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 3048), completed a survey detailing their COVID-19-related objective hardship and subjective distress during pregnancy and completed depression and anxiety measures at birth to six weeks (“Early”), seven to 21 weeks (“Moderate”), and/or 22–30 weeks (“Late”) postpartum. Findings: Higher subjective distress was associated with elevated depression and anxiety at all timepoints. Model of care did not moderate the association of objective hardship or subjective distress and depression or anxiety at any timepoint. Compared with Standard Care, women receiving private midwifery care had a 74 % reduction in the odds of elevated anxiety in early postpartum. Discussion: Women receiving private midwifery may have experienced lower anxiety due to a greater duration of postpartum in-home care, fewer changes to service delivery, and the option of homebirth. Women pregnant during a pandemic should be screened for higher subjective distress about the event. Conclusion: These results suggest that continuity of private midwifery care may be beneficial for supporting postpartum mental health during a pandemic, with implications for practice and policy for the current and future pandemics.

N2  - Background. Vaccine hesitancy is increasingly recognized as a health challenge affecting populations worldwide. Given the biological vulnerabilities and structural barriers people who use substances and/or have behavioral addictions face, this systematic review aims to evaluate whether this subpopulation is less prone to adhere to vaccination recommendations. Methods. Electronic searches of published original research were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2022. Our strategy encompassed retrievals regardless of languages and date of publication. Animal studies, abstracts without a full manuscript, and studies which were considered to have lower robustness of scientific evidence were excluded. Outcomes measured were vaccine acceptance, uptake, and adherence. Results were interpreted through a narrative synthesis. Results. The search yielded 103 retrievals encompassing data collected on 5 576 374 persons who were predominantly residents of Europe (n = 39) and North America (n = 27). Tobacco use, the substance for which many studies were found (n = 91), was significantly associated with poorer vaccine acceptance, uptake and adherence for influenza, COVID-19, human papillomavirus (HPV), and maternal and childhood vaccines. Peri-natal and parental substance use was identified as a risk factor for suboptimal vaccine-related outcomes concerning maternal COVID-19 and childhood vaccines. Finally, people identified as ‘using’, ‘abusing’, or ‘misusing’ drugs or substances may be at decreased odds of all outcomes in various vaccines. Conclusions. Collectively, the studies identified several groups with statistically significant greater vaccine hesitancy and decreased engagement among whom targeted measures could be beneficial. Timely evidence, especially on behavioral addictions and substances besides tobacco, is lacking, and warrants urgent attention.

N2  - Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to healthcare system changes aimed at minimizing disease transmission that impacted experiences with obstetric healthcare. Objective: To explore experiences of clinicians providing obstetric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five nurse practitioners and 16 obstetrical physicians providing a mix of outpatient and inpatient obstetric care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a mid-sized, Midwestern city in the United States. Interviews elucidated challenges and facilitators of obstetric care provision and vaccination of pregnant patients against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Transcripts were coded inductively then deductively using the Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF), which integrates a disparities framework and implementation framework to highlight multilevel factors that influence obstetric care. Thematic analysis was conducted, and thematic saturation was reached. Results: We interviewed 21 clinicians. Clinicians recounted personal challenges such as social isolation and burnout that could be countered by social support. Challenges within the clinical encounter included implementation of infection mitigation efforts, vaccine counseling, and limitations of telehealth. However, when successfully implemented, telehealth facilitated care and circumvented barriers. Clinicians cited challenges at the healthcare system level such as rapidly evolving knowledge and recommendations, restrictive visitor policies, personnel shortage, and inadequate institutional resources to support pandemic-related stressors. However, interdisciplinary care and guidelines available for clinicians facilitated care. Clinicians reported that challenges at the societal level included financial strain, lack of childcare, medical mistrust, politicization of medicine, misinformation, and racism. Societal-level facilitators included insurance access, community outreach, positive policy changes, and fostering trust in medicine. Conclusion: The pandemic produced unique stressors and exacerbated existing challenges for clinicians providing obstetric care. Applying the HEIF to the findings emphasizes the influence of societal factors on all other levels. Identified facilitators can inform interventions to address stressors in obstetric care that have resulted from the changed sociopolitical landscape of the pandemic.

N2  - Background: Depression during the perinatal period is associated with negative outcomes for both mothers and children, including higher rates of chronic depression in mothers and physical, emotional, and cognitive issues in children. This study aimed to determine how the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to prenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms among a sample of peripartum mothers who gave birth during the pandemic. This study also examined risk factors for postpartum depression, including prenatal depressive symptoms, demographic characteristics, timing of birth during the pandemic, pregnancy intention, birth expectations and experiences, and pandemic-related concerns. Methods: This mixed methods study included data from online surveys using a convenience sample of 284 expectant mothers with due dates from April 2020 to September 2021, and qualitative interviews with a subset of participants. Depressive symptoms and risk for clinical depression were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during the third trimester of pregnancy and again within 8 weeks postpartum. Multiple regression models examined potential risk factors to determine which variables most predicted participants’ postpartum depressive symptoms and risk of clinical depression. Results: Among this nonrepresentative, mostly white, and highly resourced sample, one-third of participants (33.8%) met the criteria for risk of clinical depression during the prenatal period, and 32.7% met this threshold in the postpartum period. Participants who reported higher levels of prenatal depressive symptoms, gave birth earlier in the pandemic, reported lower income, or had more pandemic-related concerns tended to report more postpartum depressive symptoms, adjusting for demographic characteristics and other variables of interest. Peripartum mothers who reported symptoms consistent with risk of clinical depression prenatally were almost four times more likely to screen positive for depression in the postpartum period, even after adjusting for other variables. In interviews, participants attributed negative emotions in pregnancy to uncertainty related to pandemic-related changes in care and expressed grief about missed pregnancy and postpartum experiences. In the postpartum period, some participants reported that their births were ultimately less stressful than anticipated. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for consistent and frequent depression screenings across the perinatal period, especially among participants who report depressive symptoms prenatally. Participants who gave birth early in the pandemic were at the highest risk of postpartum depression and may continue to need additional supports.

N2  - Background Stress outside of the couple relationship (extradyadic stress) can spill over into the couple relationship, increasing stress between the partners (intradyadic stress). Extra- and intradyadic stress are furthermore associated with depressive symptoms. Due to the interdependence of romantic partners, this study aimed to investigate the influence of the person’s own and their partner’s extra- and intradyadic stress on the person’s depressive symptoms in parents of toddlers. The second aim was to evaluate whether intradyadic stress mediates the within-person and between-partner association between extradyadic stress and depressive symptoms. Methods Longitudinal data of a community sample of 878 opposite-sex couples, participating in the prospective cohort study DREAM, were collected two and three years after birth. Extra- and intradyadic stress were assessed by the Multidimensional Stress Questionnaire for Couples and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. An actor-partner interdependence mediation model was applied to the data, while controlling for the confounder academic degree. Results The person’s own extradyadic stress predicted their depressive symptoms one year later, partially mediated by their intradyadic stress. The partner’s extradyadic stress and the person’s own depressive symptoms one year later were only indirectly associated through the person’s own intradyadic stress. In a sensitivity analysis, between-partner effects were no longer significant after including autoregressive pathways. Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of the extradyadic–intradyadic stress spillover for the mental health of women and men with young children. Early targeted interventions could help to prevent later depressive symptoms by reducing stress inside the couple relationship that results from both partners’ stress from outside the couple relationship.

N2  - Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Victoria's largest maternity service provider implemented a telehealth-integrated antenatal care (ANC) schedule for high- and low-risk pregnancies. The program has been maintained since March 2020. Given ever-increasing healthcare costs, economic evaluation is crucial to ensure value and guide ongoing use. Methods: The aim of the study was to perform a cost-minimisation analysis of telehealth integrated ANC compared to conventional in-person ANC, from the hospital and patient perspectives. We hypothesised that the costs associated with telehealth integrated ANC would be less than in-person ANC. We generated propensity score matched pre- and post-telehealth cohorts from women with a singleton pregnancy who received ANC and birthed at Monash Health from 1 Jan 2018–22 Mar 2020 (pre-telehealth), and 20 Apr 2020–31 Dec 2021 (post-telehealth). Data were extracted from electronic medical and finance records. We assigned costs for all Monash Health outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department episodes to calculate mean cost per birth. Patient travel costs were estimated based on distance residing from hospital. Findings: Matched pre- and post-telehealth cohorts of n = 13,534 each were created. There were no significant differences in stillbirth, pre-eclampsia, severe maternal morbidity, or death. There was a AU$133 (0.98%, 95% CI [−0.17%, 2.16%]) increase in cost per birth in the post-telehealth cohort. This was driven by increased hospital costs (AU$340 or 2.64% increase, [1.44%, 3.86%]), due to a 4.78% increase in antenatal inpatient episodes and 3.51% increase in outpatient appointments post-telehealth. Increased care complexity was noted in the post-telehealth period with increased rates of gestational diabetes, caesarean birth, and specialty-led care (p-values all <0.0001). In contrast, patient costs of accessing healthcare fell significantly from AU$562 pre-telehealth to AU$355 post-telehealth (difference -AU$207 (−36.81%, [−37.46%, −36.16%]). Interpretation: Telehealth supported the provision of a greater volume of antenatal care to more complex pregnancies, while maintaining safety and quality of care, for only a minimal cost increase to health funders and substantial cost savings to patients. This finding provides reassurance regarding the financial viability of telehealth-integrated antenatal care. Funding: None.

N2  - Many maternal and neonatal deaths can be avoided if quality healthcare is provided. To this end, the South African National Department of Health implemented a quality improvement (QI) programme (2018–2022) to improve maternal and neonatal health services in 21 public health facilities. This study sought to identify good practices aimed at improving QI teams’ performance by identifying optimal facility-level contextual factors and implementation processes. We purposively selected 14 facilities of the 21 facilities for a longitudinal qualitative process evaluation. We interviewed 17 team leaders, 47 members, and five QI advisors who provided technical support to the teams. The data were analysed using framework analysis. We choose the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as framework given that it explicates contexts and processes that shape programme implementation. Six quality improvement teams were assessed as well-performing, and eight as less well-performing. This research conceptualises a ‘life course lens’ for setting up and managing a QI team. We identified eight good practices, six related to implementation processes, and two contextual variables that will optimise team performance. The two most impactful practices to improve the performance of a QI team were (i) selecting healthcare workers with quality improvement-specific characteristics, and (ii) appointing advisors whose interpersonal skills match their technical quality improvement competencies.

N2  - Background Influenza is associated with significant global morbidity and mortality, with vaccination being the primary preventive strategy. Despite recommendations, influenza vaccine uptake among healthcare providers (HCPs) remains suboptimal, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean. We aimed to assess the attitudes and practices of HCPs in Jordan regarding seasonal influenza vaccination and assess sources of variation thereof. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among a sample of HCPs practicing in Jordan (12/29/2020–04/26/2021). Participants completed a questionnaire assessing demographics, influenza vaccination history, attitudes, and practices. We used logistic regression to evaluate factors related to vaccine receipt and reasons for non-vaccination. We used proportional odds models to evaluate factors related to HCP recommendations and to compare opinions on influenza vaccination between ever- and never-vaccinated HCPs. Results Of 305 survey initiates, 206 HCPs (67.5%) comprised the analytic sample. The median age was 35 years; 61.2% were women, and 43.7% were pharmacists. Over half (52.9%) never received an influenza vaccine; however, older age and self-identifying as a physician were associated with higher odds of having ever received the influenza vaccine. The main reasons for non-vaccination were related to the misassessment of risks and benefits. Prior receipt of influenza vaccination was strongly associated with odds of recommending vaccination (or = 10.5; 95% CI = [5.38–20.3]; p<0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic reportedly enhanced influenza vaccine acceptance among 48.5% of HCPs surveyed. Conclusions Low influenza vaccine uptake among healthcare providers in Jordan is related to misassessment of risks and benefits. Enhancing attitudes and confidence through tailored education is crucial to overcoming hesitancy and promoting sustained improvements in vaccination attitudes and practices among HCPs in Jordan.

N2  - Objective: This study utilizes the Sehat Card Plus (SCP) programme's health insurance database in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) to assess demographic characteristics, healthcare utilization patterns, and disease profiles of beneficiaries. Additionally, it analyses processes related to claims, settlements with hospitals, and the financial expenditure of the programme. Methods: The study employed the programme's third-party managed Management Information System (MIS) to obtain a sample of 100,029 beneficiary records from January 1st, 2021, to October 31st, 2022, across 10 designated study districts in KP province. After removing 5,642 duplicate records, the final dataset comprised 94,387 unique beneficiary records, subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. Results: Among women, 25,745 (50%) of admissions were in the 15-45 years age group, while 14,189 (33%) of male admissions were in the 60 and above age group. The hospital mortality rate was 5,200 (5.5%), with an average cost per admission of PKR 31,395. KP government spent PKR 2.96 billion on 94,387 patients, allocating PKR 828 million to treat cardiovascular diseases. The average cost of treating ischaemic heart disease was PKR 89,919. Empanelled hospitals took an average of 51±52.8 days to send claims, and SLIC took 21±26.1 days to settle claims. Conclusion: The third party administrators of the SCP programme maintain a robust database, capturing all hospital admissions under the SCP programme. However, improvements in database quality and the incorporation of new indicators are recommended for enhanced and independent programme monitoring and evaluation, especially with regard to equity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes characteristics of children ages 1 to 17 years who died of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 to 2022 and whose deaths were reviewed by child death review (CDR) teams across the United States. METHODS: We used data in the National Fatality Review-Case Reporting System to examine children who died of COVID-19. Deaths were determined because of COVID-19 from death certificates or CDR determinations. RESULTS: A total of 183 children 1 to 17 years old who died of COVID-19 were reported in the National Fatality Review-Case Reporting System. One-third (33%) were 15- to 17-year-olds, and 26% were 1- to 4-year-olds. Fifty-six percent were reported as male, 54% white, 24% Black, and 18% Hispanic ethnicity. Physicians declared cause of death in at least 82% of deaths. More than two-thirds (68%) had a medical condition (excluding COVID-19) at time of death. The most common conditions were nervous system disorders (19%), congenital disorders (14%), obesity (12%), respiratory disorders (12%), and neurodevelopmental disorders (10%). Of children with an underlying condition, 35% had 3 or more conditions. Less than half (42%) had contact with a health care provider within a month of their death; and three-fourths died within 14 days of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the demographics, death investigation findings, and medical conditions of children who died of COVID-19. The results highlight the short timeline between COVID-19 exposure and death. Pandemic planning that prioritizes prevention efforts and timely access to effective medical care may result in saving children's lives.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate midwives' level of stress and burnout during the COVID-19 Omicron phase in Italy. Secondary aims were to explore the impact of the pandemic on midwives' personal dimensions and professional activities and potential supporting strategies. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study was undertaken from July to December 2022. METHODS: Data were collected using a national online observational survey. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed to evaluate stress, burnout and the impact of the pandemic on personal and professional dimensions. A deductive qualitative approach was used to analyse open-ended responses, that were merged with quantitative data following a convergent mixed-methods approach. RESULTS: A total of 1944 midwives participated in the survey. The stress summary score mean was 10.34, and 562 midwives (28.91%) experienced burnout. The intention to reduce working hours was reported by 202 midwives (10.39%), with 60.40% (n = 122) of them experiencing burnout. The intention to leave clinical practice within the following 2 years was reported by 239 (12.29%), with 68.20% (n = 163) of them experiencing burnout. All the personal dimensions and professional activities considered were defined by more than half of midwives as being impacted 'Moderately' or 'To a great extent' by pandemic. Stress and burnout frequencies increased when the midwives' perception of the pandemic effects was higher. Potential supporting strategies described by midwives as the most important in increasing their ability to cope with the pandemic were 'Women's awareness of the midwives' role' (n = 1072; 55.14%) and 'Family and friends' emotional support' (n = 746; 38.38%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested strategies to support a positive and safe working environment for midwives during a pandemic emergency, with potential transferability to similar contexts when human resources are lacking. It is recommended that maternity services provide the necessary resources for a safe and supportive working environment to prevent high stress levels and chronic burnout. IMPACT: Studies conducted during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave showed an increased level of stress, anxiety, burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression experienced by healthcare professionals; moreover, midwives experienced drastic changes in care pathways and policies with struggles identified when providing high-quality woman-centred care following pandemic restrictions. Although it is recommended, there is lack of knowledge about long-term psychological effects of COVID-19 for midwives. Our study highlights that during the Omicron wave midwives experienced a high level of stress and burnout with an impact on individual dimensions and professional activities. Their stress and burnout were influenced by several factors, including restrictions in place, lack of organizational acknowledgement, work overload and need for extra childcare cover. Maternity services should provide the necessary resources for a safe and supportive working environment to prevent high stress levels and chronic burnout. Recommendations on how to facilitate this are suggested. REPORTING METHOD: During the writing process, we referred to 'The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies Epidemiology Statement', the guidelines for reporting observational studies from the Equator network. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDER GLOBAL CLINICAL COMMUNITY?: Work overload conditions negatively impacted on the quality of maternity services. Improving organizational aspects, reducing working hours, promoting family and friends' emotional support and improving women's awareness of midwife's role were the main strategies reported by midwives. These suggestions for ensuring a positive and safe working environment for midwives during a pandemic emergency could potentially be applied to similar situations where human resources are lacking.

N2  - PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 pandemic, midwives faced emotional and physical risks while on the frontlines providing care. BACKGROUND: To maintain a healthy midwifery workforce, it is necessary to understand midwives' pandemic challenges and successes, including how they personally and professionally faced changes to care provision. AIM: The aim of this meta-synthesis was to understand the experiences of midwives working during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Noblit and Hare's (1988) approach to synthesising qualitative research studies was followed. Fifteen qualitative research reports were identified using PRISMA guidelines, producing a sample of 588 midwives from 12 countries. FINDINGS: The synthesis revealed three overarching themes: (1) Turmoil and confusion: a spectrum of emotions due to ever-changing protocols, (2) COVID-19 stripped the "being with" out of midwifery care, and (3) Finding our way: midwifery resilience and growth. Analysed together, these three themes contribute to understanding the experiences of midwives working during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Midwives experienced fear, stress, and anxiety. They felt they couldn't physically be with women during the pandemic. They were frustrated by being left out of institutional decision-making regarding COVID-19 protocols that impacted the women they served. Professional growth as a midwife, and personal resilience were ultimately realised. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the routine ways in which midwives provide care in all settings. Understanding the complete experience of midwives during the pandemic allows for midwifery organizations to be aware of their members' needs, as well as for institutions to ensure supports are in place for midwives in the event of future pandemics.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe experiences of Latina women who were currently pregnant or recently gave birth around discrimination, anti-immigrant policies, and community violence during the early COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative secondary analysis. SETTING: Online or phone interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Latina women who were currently pregnant or recently gave birth (N = 26). METHODS: We used reflexive thematic analysis to examine transcribed data from semistructured interviews conducted during the early COVID-19 pandemic with a subgroup of participants enrolled in a larger study related to prenatal care. Participants were English- or Spanish-speaking, Medicaid-eligible, Latina-identifying women who resided in Fresno County, California. We analyzed responses to questions about personal discrimination, the Black Lives Matter movement, and immigration policies using the theoretical frameworks of critical race theory and the political economy of health. RESULTS: We identified four major themes: Avoidance of Community Engagement, Chronic Fear and Vigilance, The Role of Media, and Everyday Discrimination and Injustice. CONCLUSION: Participant experiences reflect the pervasiveness of fear and socioeconomic inequity and call attention to the racialized structures that affect health and health care access for Latina women. These exposures during the perinatal period may have intergenerational effects. These findings underscore the need for responsive and race-conscious perinatal nursing care for Latina women, assessment of the effect of the current sociopolitical environment on well-being, and policies that support equitable access to health and social care.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders on the breastfeeding experiences of U.S. people a identify facilitators and barriers to breastfeeding during this period, and to assess the effects of maternal stress and misinformation on breastfeeding practices. METHODS: U.S. women with infants were selected through purposive and convenience sampling. An online survey, distributed during summer 2020, measured changes in infant feeding practices, maternal stress levels, use of lactation support resources, and the influence of misinformation on feeding decisions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our sample (n = 1,861) revealed that 34% of U.S. women realized the pandemic affected their feeding practices, 544 women provided qualitative data. Major themes from qualitative analysis included ease of breastfeeding at home, bonding, increased breastfeeding duration, and challenges like limited access to lactation support. Logistic regressions highlighted demographic influences on breastfeeding practices, with no significant effects found related to the child's age or women's income on changes in feeding practices. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted breastfeeding experiences of U.S. women, yielding insights for future policy and healthcare practices. The findings underscore the potential benefits of telehealth lactation support services and flexible remote work environments for breastfeeding people. Clear and scientifically-grounded communication regarding breastfeeding, mental health support, and policy development, are essential to promote equitable and flexible work and maternity leave options for breastfeeding people especially during global health crises.

N2  - There is evidence of an overall decline in women's mental health, particularly those with young children, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, research has also found heterogeneity in women's mental health responses. This longitudinal study sampled low-income women with young children by recruiting from the government's child care financial subsidy waitlist. To examine heterogeneity in women's mental health responses to COVID-19, a latent transition analysis was employed to identify profiles of anxiety, depression, and stress among 289 low-income mothers. Using these identified profiles, we examined the transitional patterns between profiles before and during COVID-19 and the sociodemographic and familial factors related to these profiles. A three-profile solution was identified prior to COVID-19 and a four-profile solution during COVID-19, with some profiles exhibiting qualitatively different defining characteristics. Latent transition analyses found diverse patterns of mental health changes after the onset of COVID-19. Mothers with better mental health prior to COVID-19 tended to have the most stable mental health during COVID-19. In contrast, mothers who were highly stressed prior to COVID-19 were equally likely to improve or decline after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the relationships between race, parenting practices, child temperament, and child mental health were significantly related to mothers' mental health profiles. These findings describe mothers' experiences and areas where policymakers and practitioners can tailor support to low-income women with young children.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased use of digital clinical consultations (phone or video calls) within UK maternity services. This project aimed to review the evidence on digital clinical consultations in maternity systems to illuminate how, for whom and in what contexts, they can be used to support safe, personalised and equitable care. DESIGN: A realist synthesis, drawing on diverse sources of evidence (2010-present) from OECD countries, alongside insights from knowledge user groups (representing healthcare providers and service users). METHODS: The review used three analytical processes (induction, abduction and retroduction) within three iterative stages (development of initial programme theories; evidence retrieval and synthesis; validation and refinement of the programme theories). RESULTS: Ninety-three evidence sources were included in the final synthesis. Fifteen programme theories were developed showing that digital clinical consultations involve different mechanisms operating across five key contexts: the organisation, healthcare providers, the clinical relationship, the reason for consultation and women. The review suggests that digital clinical consultations can be effective and acceptable to stakeholders if there is access to appropriate infrastructure/digital resources and if implementation is able to ensure personalisation, informed choice, professional autonomy and relationship-focused connections. The review found relatively less evidence in relation to safety and equity. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the complexity of maternity systems, there can be 'no one-size fits all' approach to digital clinical consultations. Nonetheless, the review distills four 'CORE' implementation principles: C-creating the right environment, infrastructure and support for staff; O-optimising consultations to be responsive, flexible and personalised to different needs and preferences; R-recognising the importance of access and inclusion; and E-enabling quality and safety through relationship-focused connections. Service innovation and research are needed to operationalise, explore and evaluate these principles, particularly in relation to safety and equity. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021288702.

N2  - The virus infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy is a risk factor for developmental problems. Our objectives were to explore feasibility measures and verify the reliability of synchronously employing the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) remotely in infants with prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we explored the motor performance of these infants relative to an unexposed normative sample. An exploratory cross-sectional study was carried out and included 20 infants (10.65±4.99 months) whose mothers tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy. Infants were assessed with the AIMS remotely and synchronously via video call by a physical therapist. The calls were recorded. Three independent observers scored the recordings. Parents and assessors answered questions regarding barriers to and facilities for the assessments. A higher proportion of parents (90%) found it easy to understand and replicate the commands provided by the therapist during the assessment (P<0.001). The assessors reported not encountering difficulty in most assessments. Interobserver reliability was good in the standing posture [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.734–0.942, P<0.001] and excellent (95% CI: 0.970–0.996, P<0.001) in prone, supine, and sitting. Intra-rater reliability was excellent (95% CI’s: 0.876–1.000, P’s<0.001) in all postures. There were no differences between the motor performance of exposed infants compared to the unexposed normative sample. It was feasible to assess the motor performance of infants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via video call with good to excellent inter- and intra-rater reliabilities, making it an important approach when social distancing is needed.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy and the postpartum period, women's mental health can deteriorate quickly. Timely and easy access to services is critically important; however, little is known about the pathways women take to access services. Previous research has shown that women from ethnic minority groups in the United Kingdom experience more access issues compared to the White British women. Aim: To describe pathways taken to specialist community perinatal mental health services and explore how they vary across services and ethnic groups. Methods: This is a two-site, longitudinal retrospective service evaluation conducted in Birmingham and London during 6 months (1 July-31 December 2019). Electronic records of 228 women were accessed and data were extracted on help-seeking behaviour, referral process and the type of pathway (i.e. simple or complex). Data were collected using the adapted World Health Organization encounter form and analysed using uni- and multivariable analyses. Results: The median time from the start of perinatal mental illness to contact with perinatal mental health services was 20 weeks. The majority of patients accessed perinatal mental health services through primary care (69%) and their pathway was simple, that is they saw one service before perinatal mental health services (63%). The simple pathway was used as a proxy for accessible services. In Birmingham, compared to London, more referrals came from secondary care, more women were experiencing current deterioration in mental health, and more women followed a complex pathway. Despite differences between ethnic groups regarding type of pathway and duration of patient journey, there was no evidence of difference when models controlled for confounders such as clinical presentation, general characteristics and location. The service's location was the strongest predictor of the type of pathway and duration of patient journey. Limitations: The heterogeneity among categorised ethnic groups; data extracted from available electronic records and not validated with patient's own accounts of their pathways to care; unanalysed declined referrals; the study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and pathways may be different in the post-COVID-19 period. Conclusion: The study provides important insights into how patients find their way to community perinatal mental health services. It shows that there is a great degree of variability in the time taken to get into these services, and the pathway taken. This variation does not come from different needs of patients or different clinical presentations but rather from service-level factors. Future work: The studied community perinatal mental health services in the United Kingdom operate with a significant degree of variability in the types and characteristics of patient pathways. Future research should explore these issues on the national and international levels. Additionally, future research should explore the reasons for the different pathways taken and the outcomes and risks associated with them. Funding: This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme as award number 17/105/14.

N2  - Objective: To analyze COVID-19 vaccine uptake in children and to investigate factors associated with two outcomes variables: (a) not even beginning; (b) not completing the COVID-19 vaccine series. Methods: We used data of children aged 6–7 years from the 2015 Pelotas c Birth Cohort Study. COVID-19 vaccination status was collected from immunization cards and National Immunization Program Information System. Adjusted analyses were performed using a hierarchical model to identify factors associated with the two study outcomes. Results: Among 3867 children, 20.7 % (95 % CI, 19.5 %–22.0 %) did not even begin the 2-dose primary COVID-19 vaccine series, and 28.2 % (95 % CI, 26.6 %–29.8 %) did not complete the series with the second dose. Children not even beginning the COVID-19 vaccine series were more likely to have a White mother, not to have obesity, to have a history of COVID-19 infection, to have received non-recommended drugs for COVID-19, to be afraid of needles, and to have an incomplete diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and poliovirus immunization schedule. Not completing the 2-dose series was associated with lower maternal age and education, mother's self-identification as White or Brown, lower household income, lack of access to health services, not having completed the DTP and poliovirus immunization schedule and living with a person with a history of infection with COVID-19. Conclusion: The results highlight a vaccine-hesitant parents’ group who chose not beginning the COVID-19 vaccine series of their children and, another group of parents who failure to complete the child's series due to difficulty accessing health services.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia and sleep problems are common in pregnancy and have potentially negative impacts on both parental and infant health. This study examined the sleeping for two adaptation of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in pregnancy. METHODS: A parallel (1:1) randomized controlled trial evaluated CBT-I (n=32) compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) waitlist (n=32) among pregnant individuals from Alberta, Canada experiencing insomnia. Five weekly individual sessions of CBT-I pivoted from in-person delivery to telehealth due to COVID-19 pandemic physical distancing regulations. Insomnia symptom severity (primary outcome), insomnia diagnosis by structured interview, self-reported sleep problems, as well as sleep parameters measured by diary and actigraphy, were assessed pre-treatment at 12-28 weeks gestation (T1), one-week post-treatment (T2), and six months postpartum (T3). Birth information (secondary outcomes) were collected via delivery record and parent report of infant sleep (exploratory outcome) was taken at T3. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling using an intention-to-treat approach showed that CBT-I was associated with a decrease in insomnia symptoms and improved sleep quality across time compared to TAU. The CBT-I group had fewer diagnoses of insomnia post-treatment, but the difference did not reach statistical significance until 6-months postpartum. Participants with worse sleep quality at baseline benefitted substantially more from CBT-I vs. TAU waitlist. CONCLUSIONS: CBT-I delivered in pregnancy can reduce symptoms of insomnia and improve sleep quality, which could in turn minimize risk of negative consequences for birthing parent and infant health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the maternal-infant dyad, especially due to visitation restrictions in neonatal units. These changes may impact the psychological, physical, and developmental health of mothers and newborns. PURPOSE: This systematic review evaluates the impact of enforced separation and restrictive visitation policies in neonatal units during the pandemic, focusing on the maternal-infant dyad. DATA SOURCES: Data sources include CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, APA PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, and Embase, covering studies published between 2020 and 2024. STUDY SELECTION: A detailed search was conducted using terms related to COVID-19, maternal and neonatal health, and visitation restrictions in neonatal units. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed, written in English, and focused on the impact of visitation restrictions on maternal and neonatal health. DATA EXTRACTION: The data extraction process began with 789 references. After removing duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts. We then conducted a full-text assessment of the remaining studies, selecting 14 that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The analysis showed significant emotional, psychological, and developmental impacts on mothers and newborns due to pandemic-induced separation and inconsistent policies. It highlighted depressive symptoms, stress, bonding disruptions, and the effectiveness of virtual bonding. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: The review emphasizes the need for family-centered care, coping strategies, and virtual bonding in neonatal units. It calls for culturally sensitive policies to support mothers and infants during crises. The review also highlights the importance of studying the long-term effects of pandemic-induced separations and improving support for future health emergencies.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led prevention researchers to increasingly use remote observational procedures given social distancing directives associated with the pandemic. However, few studies have used remote observational procedures with children and their caregivers, with scant literature describing procedures with socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse families. This manuscript describes processes to pivot to remote assessment of parent and child observations in the context of a longitudinal study examining the effects of a postpartum depression preventive intervention on responsive parenting and child self-regulation. We conducted remote assessments across three timepoints-42, 48, and 54 months-with 133 low-income and racially and ethnically diverse parent-child dyads. Details are provided on remote observation preparation and setup, as well as adaptation of observational assessments. Lessons learned are shared on the use of technology, scheduling considerations, parent's role as facilitator, maintaining child engagement, and cost considerations. We demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability between independent coders on all assessments, suggesting the quality of remote assessments was conducive for analysis. Surveys with families completing a remote assessment found that most felt it was easy to participate in remote assessments and their child had a positive experience. Most parents preferred virtual visits if given an option for future assessments. Much prevention research utilizes observational measures that are less subject to bias. Our study demonstrated that research teams can effectively and reliably pivot to remote assessment with racially and ethnically diverse, low socioeconomic families, thereby providing guidance to other prevention researchers considering similar remote assessments with diverse samples.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to determine how obstetrician-gynecologists provided telehealth from January 2020 to December 2022 in the United States, using de-identified commercial insurance data from FAIR Health. It also explores the trends in telehealth provision by physicians' age, gender, and by state policies on telehealth payment parity. Methods: Aggregated, de-identified data derived from medical claims containing 450,588 physician-quarter observations during 2020 to 2022 were analyzed using descriptive methods to examine the total number of telehealth services to pregnant individuals provided, the number of obstetrician-gynecologists that provided telehealth, and the mean number of telehealth services provided per quarter. Results: Obstetrician-gynecologists' telehealth provision increased rapidly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching its peak during the winter 2020 wave (fourth quarter) during which 4,663 obstetrician-gynecologists provided 13,846 telehealth visits. This was followed by a drop in subsequent quarters and during the fourth quarter of 2022, about 9,500 visits were provided by 2,800 obstetrician-gynecologists. Mean number of telehealth visits per physician was higher among older obstetrician-gynecologists and among those that practiced in states that adapted telehealth payment parity policies. Conclusions: Physician sex, age, and the state of practice location impacted their telehealth provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future policies aimed at ensuring telehealth access for pregnant people should consider these factors.

N2  - Objective Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at elevated risk for severe outcomes, but clinical data on management of these patients are limited. Monoclonal antibodies, such as casirivimab plus imdevimab (CAS+IMD), have proven effective in treating non-pregnant adults with COVID-19, prompting further evaluation in pregnant women. Methods A phase 3 portion of an adaptive, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, clinical outcomes, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of CAS+IMD (1200 mg or 2400 mg) in the treatment of pregnant outpatients with COVID-19 (NCT04425629). Participants were enrolled between December 2020 and November 2021, prior to the emergence of Omicron-lineage variants against which CAS+IMD is not active. Safety was evaluated in randomised participants who received study drug (n=80); clinical outcomes were evaluated in all randomised participants (n=82). Only two pregnant participants received placebo, limiting conclusions regarding treatment effect. Infants born to pregnant participants were followed for developmental outcomes ≤1 year of age. Results In pregnant participants, CAS+IMD was well tolerated, with no grade ≥2 hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions reported. There were no participant deaths, and only one COVID-19-related medically attended visit. Although two pregnancies (3%) reported issues in the fetus/neonate, they were confounded by maternal history or considered to be due to an alternate aetiology. No adverse developmental outcomes in infants ≤1 year of age were considered related to in utero exposure to the study drug. CAS+IMD 1200 mg and 2400 mg rapidly and similarly reduced viral loads, with a dose-proportional increase in concentrations of CAS+IMD in serum. Pharmacokinetics were consistent with that reported in the general population. Immunogenicity incidence was low. Conclusion CAS+IMD treatment of pregnant outpatients with COVID-19 showed similar safety, clinical outcomes and pharmacokinetic profiles to that observed in non-pregnant adults. There was no evidence of an impact on developmental outcomes in infants ≤1 year of age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The lockdown measures in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have led to a wide range of unintended consequences for women and children. Until the outbreak of COVID-19, attention was on reducing maternal and infant mortality due to pregnancy and delivery complications. The aim of this study was to interrogate the impact of lockdown measures on women and children in two contrasting districts in Ghana - Krobo Odumase and Ayawaso West Wuogon. METHODS: This study adopted the mixed-method approach using both qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative study relied on two data collection methods to explore the impacts of COVID-19 control measures on women and children in Ghana. These were: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs; n = 12) and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs; n = 18). The study complemented the qualitative data with survey data - household surveys (n = 78) which were used to support the nutrition and school closure data; and policy data gathered from government websites consisting of government responses to COVID-19. The qualitative data was analysed using the thematic approach with codes generated apriori with the NVIVO software. The quantitative data used percentages and frequencies. RESULTS: Engagements with participants in the study revealed that the lockdown measures implemented in Ghana had consequences on child and maternal health, and the health care system as a whole. Our study revealed, for example, that there was a decrease in antenatal and postnatal attendance in hospitals. Childhood vaccinations also came to a halt. Obesity and malnutrition were found to be common among children depending on the location of our study participants (urban and rural areas respectively). Our study also revealed that TB, Malaria and HIV treatment seeking reduced due to the fear of going to health facilities since those ailments manifest similar symptoms as COVID 19. CONCLUSION: Government responded to COVID-19 using different strategies however the policy response resulted in both intended and unintended consequences especially for women and children in Ghana. It is recommended that national policy directions should ensure the continuous provision of child and maternal healthcare services which are essential health services during lockdowns.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected physical and psychological health worldwide. Pregnant women were likely more vulnerable to mental health difficulties due to the significant social, psychological, and hormonal changes they experience. During the pandemic, higher rates of antenatal depression and anxiety were observed compared to pre-pandemic rates. Increased mental health symptoms in pregnancy have been associated with adverse outcomes for child development. Understanding pandemic-specific preventive behaviours (i.e., mask use, physical distancing) and concerns may also be linked to maternal psychological well-being. Purpose: To compare matched pregnant and non-pregnant women (N = 474) to assess COVID-19 psychosocial impacts, preventive behaviours, and concerns. Methods: This study used a matched analysis of data collected by the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation (iCARE) Study. Participants were matched on several demographic factors and analyses were adjusted for chronic illness and psychiatric disorder. Results: Linear regression analyses indicated that pregnant women did not significantly differ from matched non-pregnant women for psychosocial impacts (B = 0.11, SE = 0.08, p = 0.178). Those who reported a chronic illness (B=-0.19, SE = 0.09, p = 0.036) or a psychiatric disorder (B=-0.28, SE = 0.09, p = 0.003) were more likely to report more significant psychosocial impacts. Logistic regression analyses indicated that pregnant women were more likely to report staying at home rather than going to work (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.31–3.08, p = 0.002) and being concerned about being infected (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.05–2.46, p = 0.028). Conclusions: Our findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need to consider interventions targeting women, with chronic illnesses or psychiatric disorders, as they are often the most vulnerable.

N2  - Caregivers are instrumental in the development of infant emotion regulation; however, few studies have focused on delineating the real-time effectiveness of strategies that caregivers use to reduce infant distress. It is also unclear whether certain caregiver traits facilitate engagement in more successful regulation strategies. This study addressed these gaps by: (1) examining the differential effectiveness of maternal regulatory attempts (MRAs; behavioral strategies initiated by mothers to assist infants with regulating emotional states) in reducing 12- to 24-month-old infants' frustration during a toy removal task; and (2) assessing whether maternal mind-mindedness (mothers' attunement to their infant's mental state) predicted mothers' selection of MRAs. Multilevel modeling revealed that distraction and control were the most effective MRAs in reducing infant negative affect across 5-s intervals (N = 82 dyads; M infant age = 18 months; 45 females). Greater use of non-attuned mind-related speech predicted less engagement in effective MRAs, supporting a link between caregivers' socio-cognitive skills and provision of in-the-moment regulation support. These findings highlight the value of considering caregiver regulatory behaviors as a target for elucidating how maternal socialization of emotion regulation occurs in real-time. They also underscore mothers' important role as socializing agents in the development of this foundational developmental ability.

N2  - Background: Mother-to-infant bonding (MIB) is foundational for nurturing behaviors and an infant’s development. Identifying risk factors for difficulties or problems in MIB is vital. However, traditional research often dichotomizes MIB using cutoff thresholds, overlooking its underlying complexities. This research utilizes latent profile analysis (LPA) to discern MIB subtypes in a nationwide Japanese dataset. Methods: We conducted LPA on data from the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS), collected from 3,877 postpartum women within one year of childbirth. To empirically validate the derived profiles, we examined their associated risk factors, focusing on sociodemographic, health, and perinatal variables. Results: Four distinct MIB profiles emerged. Profile 1 indicated minimal difficulties, while Profile 4 exhibited severe multifaceted difficulties. Profiles 2 and 3 showed moderate difficulties distinguished by lack of positive affection and presence of negative affection (especially indifference), respectively. Compared to Profile 1, women in Profiles 2–4 had a higher likelihood of postpartum depression and low family support. Each profile also presented unique risk factors: medium family support in Profile 2, maternal working status in Profile 3, and pre-pregnancy underweight status in Profile 4. Notably, both Profiles 3 and 4 were also linked to increased feelings of loneliness since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This study represents the first application of LPA to MIB, revealing distinct subtypes and their respective risk profiles. These insights promise to enhance and personalize early interventions for difficulties in MIB, affirming the necessity of acknowledging MIB’s heterogeneity.

N2  - Background: Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as 5 min or more of seizure activity or two recurrent seizures without a return to baseline. Healthcare providers encounter a challenge when a patient with SE is pregnant. SE is not only detrimental to the mother but can also put the baby at risk of severe harm. SE must be treated rapidly and therefore healthcare providers have very little time to thoroughly review the risk and benefits of available antiseizure medication in this population. Aim: To evaluate the current available evidence related to the management of SE in pregnancy. Design: A literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health Source, and Web of Science databases was conducted (2012–2022) using the following search terms: ‘pregnancy’, ‘pregnant women’ OR ‘gestation’ AND ‘status epilepticus’, ‘generalized status epilepticus’, ‘generalized convulsive status epilepticus’, ‘non convulsive status epilepticus’ OR ‘non-convulsive status epilepticus’. Full-text randomised controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports published in English were included. Data were extracted and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: The literature described 29 pregnancies and 30 total foetuses. Intravenous benzodiazepine use for emergent control was reported in 45% of patients. Phenytoin and levetiracetam were primarily utilised for urgent control, with a variety of agents used for refractory SE. Ninety-seven percent of maternal outcomes were reported as positive. The most common outcome was the birth of a healthy term infant. There were seven cases of pregnancy loss. Conclusion: Publications pertaining to the treatment of SE in pregnancy are limited to case reports and small observational studies. Use of a benzodiazepine followed by levetiracetam or phenytoin is appropriate, whereas valproic acid should be utilised only when necessary due to the risk of major congenital malformation.

N2  - Background: The ICE3 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of cryoablation in women aged ≥60 years with low-risk, early-stage breast cancers, aiming to provide a non-operative treatment option and avoid potential surgical risks. This study presents 5-year follow-up trial results. Methods: The ICE3 trial is an Institutional Review Board-approved, prospective, multicentered, non-randomized trial including women ≥ 60 years of age with unifocal, ultrasound visible, invasive ductal carcinoma ≤ 1.5 cm in size, histologic grade 1–2, hormone receptor (HR)-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative. The primary study endpoint of 5-year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was evaluated based on Kaplan–Meier estimates. Results: Overall, 194 patients meeting eligibility received successful cryoablation treatment per protocol and were included for analysis. The mean age was 74.9 years (55–94) with a mean tumor size of 7.4 mm transverse (2.8–14.0 mm) and 8.1 mm sagittal (2.5–14.9 mm). With a mean follow-up period of 54.16 months, the IBTR rate at 5 years was 4.3% and breast cancer survival was 96.7%. Of the 124 patients who received endocrine therapy only, the IBTR was 3.7%. No serious device-related adverse events were reported. Minor (88.2%) and moderate (9.6%) adverse events were mild in severity and resolved without residual effects. Quality-of-life score demonstrated statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) in distress at 6 months as compared with baseline. Conclusions: Breast cryoablation presents a promising alternative to surgery in selected patients, offering the benefits of a minimally invasive procedure with minimal risks. Further studies are encouraged to confirm cryoablation as a viable alternative to surgical excision low-risk patients.

N2  - Introduction: Access to prenatal care offers the opportunity for providers to assess for substance use disorders (SUDs) and to offer important treatment options, but utilization of treatment during pregnancy has been difficult to measure. This study presents pre-COVID trends of a subset of SUD diagnosis at the time of delivery and related trends in treatment utilization during pregnancy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort design was used for the analysis of West Virginia Medicaid claims data from 2016 to 2019. Diagnosis of SUDs at the time of delivery and treatment utilization for opioid use disorder (OUD) and non-OUD diagnosis during pregnancy across time were the principal outcomes of interest. This study examined data from n = 49,398 pregnant individuals. Results: Over the 4-year period, a total of 2,830 (5.7%) individuals had a SUD diagnosis at the time of delivery. The frequency of opioid-related diagnoses decreased by 29.3%; however, non-opioid SUD diagnoses increased by 55.8%, with the largest increase in the diagnosis of stimulant use disorder (30.9%). Treatment for OUD increased by 13%, but treatment for non-opioid SUD diagnoses during pregnancy declined by 41.1% during the same period. Conclusions: Interventions enacted within West Virginia have improved access and utilization of treatment for OUD in pregnancy. However, consistent with national trends in the general population, non-opioid SUD diagnoses, especially for stimulants, have rapidly increased, while treatment for this group decreased. Early identification and referral to treatment by OB-GYN providers are paramount to reducing pregnancy and postpartum complications for the mother and neonate.

N2  - Introduction: With the spread of COVID-19, certain population groups, including pregnant women, were more susceptible than others. This disease can lead to postpartum complications, including mental disorders, in mothers. Few studies have investigated the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on mental health, and the most effective counseling approach to promote mental health has not been identified. Objective: This study aimed to determine the impact of online mindfulness-based counseling on improving mental health among women with a history of COVID-19 during pregnancy in Iran. Methods: The present study was a quasi-experimental design conducted on 100 women with a history of coronavirus infection during pregnancy referred to the Mother's Clinic of Yahya Nejad and Ayatollah Rouhani Educational-Treatment Hospital, affiliated with Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran, via convenience sampling. The women were randomly assigned to the intervention (mindfulness-based counseling) and control groups. The intervention group received eight 45-min weekly mindfulness-based counseling sessions over 8 weeks. Data were collected via a demographic information questionnaire and the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire before and after the intervention, which were completed by both groups. Independent t-tests and analysis of covariances (ANCOVAs) were used to compare the outcomes of the two groups. Results: After controlling for confounding variables, the mean mental health scores before and after counseling were 29.42 ± 4.49 and 19.80 ± 3.88, respectively, in the intervention group and 26.26 ± 2.29 and 25.92 ± 2.15, respectively, in the control group. The mean mental health score in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (F = 266.7, p < 0.001). The mean scores for somatic symptoms (F = 89.30, p < 0.001), depression symptoms (F = 142.71, p < 0.001), anxiety and insomnia symptoms (F = 120.56, p < 0.001), and social dysfunction scores (F = 127.77, p < 0.001) were significantly different between the two groups after counseling. Conclusion: The findings indicated that online mindfulness-based counseling positively affects mental health and its domains during the postpartum period. However, further randomized clinical trials are needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. Trial Registration: We were not allowed to register according to the law of our country.

N2  - Vaccine hesitancy, a pressing global challenge in vaccination programs, was significantly amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proliferation of misinformation, including false claims and rumours, and the influence of anti-vaccine movements fuelled hesitancy. This study aims to explore the socio-economic determinants that influenced vaccine hesitancy and the impact of public health information sharing in Sri Lanka during the pandemic. The study employed a comprehensive mixed-method approach for data collection, administrating a household survey (n = 3330) and 206 semi-structured interviews. The survey results indicated that 37.8% (n = 3113) of respondents delayed or rejected vaccines for various reasons, the leading cause being the fear of side effects of the vaccine. Although fear of side effects was the prime reason for rejection (n = 1176, 46.29%), respondents demonstrated an extremely poor understanding of the potential side effects of vaccines, which was 55.39% (n = 3113). Notably, 84.60% (n = 3113) were unaware of the vaccine development process. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that middle-income people (AOR—0.42) and females (0.65) were less likely not to make decisions based on scientific information compared to underprivileged people and males. The survey also revealed that strong belief in the use of traditional medicines and remedies and religious beliefs (n = 1176, 3.95%) were among the main reasons for hesitancy. The findings illustrate that misinformation, lack of health knowledge, and lack of understanding to seek scientific information have fuelled vaccine hesitancy in Sri Lanka.

N2  - Introduction: Vaccination protects pregnant women against dangerous infectious diseases and contributes to disease prevention for the child until their vaccination schedule begins. Vaccination behaviour is related to attitudes concerning vaccine prevention. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional, non-representative study was conducted among Polish mothers using a diagnostic survey. We used the Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) Scale. The author’s questionnaire included questions concerning experiences with adult and maternal vaccinations, as well as sociodemographic data. Results: Among the 375 respondents, more than half (n = 208, 55.47%) received at least one vaccine during pregnancy. The majority of respondents had a university education (n = 356, 94.93%). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of receiving vaccines during pregnancy between respondents with and without a healthcare education (p = 0.230). A logistic regression model indicated that women who were vaccinated outside pregnancy for COVID-19 (OR 4.61, 2.60–8.22) and influenza (OR 7.14, 3.58–14.25) were statistically significantly more likely to be vaccinated during pregnancy. There were statistically significant differences between women who were vaccinated during pregnancy and those who did not receive maternal immunisation in three subscales of the VAX Scale: Mistrust of Vaccine Benefit, Concerns about Commercial Profiteering, and Preference for Natural Immunity (p < 0.001). The most frequently indicated reason for a woman’s decision to be vaccinated was concern for the health and safety of the unborn child (n = 196, 94.23%). In contrast, women who were not vaccinated reported fear for the health and safety of the unborn child (n = 88, 52.69%). Conclusions: A key point may be to contribute to the vaccinology education of healthcare professionals, who play an important role in pregnant women’s decision to be vaccinated. However, our results may be disrupted because the majority of the women in our study had a university education.

N2  - Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, with Eastern Europe experiencing notable excess morbidity and mortality and vaccine hesitancy. This study utilized the Behavior Integration (BI) framework to identify barriers and motivators for COVID-19 vaccination and develop strategies to increase vaccine demand and confidence in Moldova, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Methods. A mixed-methods approach was employed, including qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. The BI framework was used to integrate human behaviors with technical and operational considerations throughout the project. Results. A total of 2742 online surveys were collected in Moldova and Serbia, revealing significant barriers such as vaccine safety concerns (OR = 1.839, 95% CI: 1.328–2.547 in urban Moldova; OR = 1.990, 95% CI: 1.351–2.931 in urban Serbia), logistical challenges, and lack of institutional trust. Conversely, motivators included personal health concerns, recommendations from health care providers, and the desire to travel. The proposed social and behavior change strategy included a continuing medical education course that trained 2403 medical providers, with post-test results showing a 99% improvement in knowledge and confidence in applying the information, and collective engagement workshops for 3260 chronic disease patients and 842 pregnant women, of which 7% were vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusions. The BI approach effectively identified and addressed vaccination barriers and motivators, leading to tailored strategies that increased vaccine uptake. Continuous stakeholder engagement, adaptive learning processes, and local organizations are crucial for refining program implementation, ensuring sustainability, and promoting public health.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the frequency and predictors of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Methodology: This retrospective analysis involved patients over the age of 12 who were monitored at the endocrine clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh from July 2019 to July 2020. A comparison was made between patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and those without, utilizing the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Independent risk factors were determined through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Among the 262 patients diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), 56.1% were female, with an average age of 22.6 years (± 8.07). Approximately 58% of these patients reported a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and 46.9% experienced DKA at the time of diagnosis. The average glycated hemoglobin level recorded was 9.0% (± 1.80). Missing appointments at the endocrine clinic was linked to increased hospital admissions due to DKA. Of those with a DKA history, 81.6% experienced it once annually, while 18.4% had multiple hospitalizations. The average age of patients during admission was 18.1 years (± 7.33), with an average hospital stay of 2.9 days (± 1.53). Although most DKA episodes were classified as mild to moderate, 19.7% were severe. The primary reason for DKA was identified as noncompliance with insulin therapy, accounting for 52% of cases. Conclusions: DKA is frequently observed in individuals with T1DM in Saudi Arabia, largely attributed to nonadherence to insulin therapy. Around one-third of these patients encounter recurrent or severe episodes of DKA. It is advisable to engage in regular conversations regarding insulin adherence and the management of illness-related complications.

In particular, anxiety and depressive symptoms, sleep satisfaction, perinatal stress, bonding, social support or fear of COVID-19, during pregnancy and 6-weeks after delivery were explored. Student's t-test, chi-square and repeated measure analysis of variance were used for comparisons when appropriate Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in any of the variables analysed, except for the mothers’ education, which was higher in the control group. Regarding the timing of infection, those who were infected during the first trimester reported lower levels of perceived social support and higher levels of anxiety Conclusions: These findings suggest that the emotional impact of the pandemic may be similar throughout the population, regardless of infection status. However, the impact of the COVID-19 on mental health of future mothers appears to be more significant during the early stages of pregnancy. These results underscore the relevance of providing adequate support from the early stages of pregnancy, in order to enhance women well-being.

N2  - Background: Postpartum depression can lead to situations in new mothers that affect baby care, impacting their feeding by reducing adherence to exclusive breastfeeding. Therefore, it is important to identify the factors associated with this condition. Objective: To determine which sociodemographic factors are associated with postpartum depression in postpartum women at a Peruvian hospital. Materials and methods: Observational, cross-sectional, and analytical research. Design: Case-control research design. Site: Regional Hospital of Ica-Peru. Participants: A total of 173 cases (postpartum women at risk of postpartum depression) were studied and compared with 173 controls (postpartum women without risk of postpartum depression). All participants were surveyed between the months of May and October 2022, 15 to 30 days after delivery. Interventions: Survey. Main measures: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to obtain the metric of the dependent variable, and a general data sheet to obtain independent variables. The cutoff point for the Edinburgh Scale was ≥ 13. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 18.8% (95% CI = 16.3-21.3). The associated factors were: Age under 20 years OR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.4) p = 0.001. Higher education level OR: 4.5 (95% CI: 2.8-7.0) p = 0.000. Single marital status OR: 4.4 (95% CI: 2.8-6.9) p = 0.000. Poor relationship with partner OR: 3.9 (95% CI: 2.4-6.1) p = 0.000. Use of Psychotropic drugs OR: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7-4.4) p = 0.000. Complications during labor OR: 2.6 (95% CI: 1.6-4.3) p = 0.000. Cesarean delivery OR: 3.3 (95% CI: 2.1-5.1) p = 0.000. History of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy OR: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.7-4.2) p = 0.000. Employment status OR: 3.2 (95% CI: 2.1-5.0) p = 0.000. Conclusion: Postpartum depression is associated with sociodemographic variables in the patient's environment that require timely intervention to reduce negative effects on both the mother and the child.

N2  - Fetal death is defined as the spontaneous cessation of cardiac activity after fourteen weeks of amenorrhea. In France, the prevalence of fetal death after 22 weeks is between 3.2 and 4.4/1000 births. Regarding the prevention of fetal death in the general population, it is not recommended to counsel for rest and not to prescribe vitamin A, vitamin D nor micronutrient supplementation for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of fetal death (Weak recommendations; Low quality of evidence). It is not recommended to prescribe aspirin (Weak recommendation; Very low quality of evidence). It is recommended to offer vaccination against influenza in epidemic periods and against SARS-CoV-2 (Strong recommendations; Low quality of evidence). It is not recommended to systematically look for nuchal cord encirclements during prenatal screening ultrasounds (Strong Recommendation; Low Quality of Evidence) and not to perform systematic antepartum monitoring by cardiotocography (Weak Recommendation; Very Low Quality of Evidence). It is not recommended to ask women to perform an active fetal movement count to reduce the risk of fetal death (Strong Recommendation; High Quality of Evidence). Regarding evaluation in the event of fetal death, it is suggested that an external fetal examination be systematically offered (Expert opinion). It is recommended that a fetopathological and anatomopathological examination of the placenta be carried out to participate in cause identification (Strong Recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence). It is recommended that chromosomal analysis by microarray testing be performed rather than conventional karyotype, in order to be able to identify a potentially causal anomaly more frequently (Strong Recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); to this end, it is suggested that postnatal sampling of the placental fetal surface for genetic purposes be preferred (Expert Opinion). It is suggested to test for antiphospholipid antibodies and systematically perform a Kleihauer test and a test for irregular agglutinins (Expert opinion). It is suggested to offer a summary consultation, with the aim of assessing the physical and psychological status of the parents, reporting the results, discussing the cause and providing information on monitoring for a subsequent pregnancy (Expert opinion). Regarding announcement and support, it is suggested to announce fetal death without ambiguity, using simple words and adapting to each situation, and then to support couples with empathy in the various stages of their care (Expert opinion). Regarding management, it is suggested that, in the absence of a situation at risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation or maternal vitality, the patient's wishes should be taken into account when determining the time between the diagnosis of fetal death and induction of birth. Returning home is possible if it's the patient wish (Expert opinion). In all situations excluding maternal life-threatening emergencies, the preferred mode of delivery is vaginal delivery, regardless the history of cesarean section(s) history (Expert opinion). In the event of fetal death, it is recommended that mifepristone 200 mg be prescribed at least 24 hours before induction, to reduce the delay between induction and delivery (Low recommendation. Low quality of evidence). There are insufficient data in the literature to make a recommendation regarding the route of administration (vaginal or oral) of misoprostol, neither the type of prostaglandin to reduce induction-delivery time or maternal morbidity. It is suggested that perimedullary analgesia be introduced at the start of induction if the patient asks, regardless of gestational age. It is suggested to prescribe cabergoline immediately in the postpartum period in order to avoid lactation, whatever the gestational age, after discussing the side effects of the treatment with the patient (Expert opinion). The risk of recurrence of fetal death after unexplained fetal death does not appear to be increased in subsequent pregnancies, and data from the literature are insufficient to make a recommendation on the prescription of aspirin. In the event of a history of fetal death due to vascular issues, low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce perinatal morbidity, and should not be combined with heparin therapy (Low recommendation, very low quality of evidence). It is suggested not to recommend an optimal delay before initiating another pregnancy just because of the history of fetal death. It is suggested that the woman and co-parent be informed of the possibility of psychological support. Fetal heart rate monitoring is not indicated solely because of a history of fetal death. It is suggested that delivery not be systematically induced. However, induction can be considered depending on the context and parental request. The gestational age will be discussed, taking into account the benefits and risks, especially before 39 weeks. If a cause of fetal death is identified, management will be adapted on a case-by-case basis (expert opinion). In the event of fetal death occurring in a twin pregnancy, it is suggested that the surviving twin be evaluated as soon as the diagnosis of fetal death is made. In the case of dichorionic pregnancy, it is suggested to offer ultrasound monitoring on a monthly basis. It is suggested not to deliver prematurely following fetal death of a twin. If fetal death occurs in a monochorionic twin pregnancy, it is suggested to contact the referral competence center, in order to urgently look for signs of acute fetal anemia on ultrasound in the surviving twin, and to carry out weekly ultrasound monitoring for the first month. It is suggested not to induce birth immediately.

N2  - Objective Given the critical importance of maternal mental health for the well-being of both the mother and fetus, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health. This study aims to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 infection and mental health, underscoring the necessity of effective mental health management for pregnant women. Methods Data were analyzed from 97 pregnant women who visited Gachon University Gil hospital in South Korea. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection status was categorized based on whether the infection occurred during pregnancy. Maternal anxiety, the dependent variable, was measured using the state anxiety scale of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between COVID-19 infection and anxiety. Results Among the 97 pregnant women, 50 (51.5%) experienced anxiety. Of those infected with COVID-19, 31 (64.6%) experienced anxiety. The mean anxiety score was significantly higher in pregnant women with COVID-19 infection compared to those without infection (Infected: Mean = 46.35, SD = 13.85; Non-infected: Mean = 39.59, SD = 10.58, p-value:0.008). Maternal depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were significantly higher in pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, while fetal attachment showed no significant difference. Pregnant women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy were more likely to experience anxiety compared to non-infected women (Adjusted OR = 9.37; 95% CI = 1.39–63.12). Conclusion This study highlights that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are more likely to experience elevated levels of anxiety, emphasizing the critical importance of addressing mental health among pregnant women. The insights from this study could provide valuable guidance for policymaking, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to manage mental health in pregnant women and mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes.

N2  - Background Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to health systems, with countries needing to balance the demands of responding directly to the pandemic, while simultaneously continuing provision of essential health services. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on essential healthcare services in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based retrospective study was undertaken in 30 health centers in Addis Ababa which were selected using simple random sampling. Secondary data were extracted for 22 indicators on maternal and child health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, and outpatient services for the period spanning between July 2019 and October 2020. These indicators were selected based on the WHO operational guidance on maintaining essential health services during an outbreak guide, essential packages of health services in Ethiopia and expert consultation. The difference in the trends of services before and during COVID-19 was compared using linear-by-linear tests and the difference of magnitude across the indicators was compared using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) interrupted time series analysis at a 5% significance level. Results Overall, more than 1.7 million people visited the studied facilities for outpatient services, and 18,325 mothers attended skilled delivery in the study period. The present study found that the mean number of patients treated for TB declined by 35 patients (β: -34.62; 95%CI: -50.29, -18.95) compared to the pre-COVID-19 era while the number of new patients enrolled for ART decreased by 71 patients (β: -70.62; 95%CI: -107.19, -34.05). Regarding maternal health services, the number of women who received post-natal care decreased by about 215 mothers (β: -214.87; 95%CI: -331.57, -98.17). Similarly, the mean number of clients served at inpatient services declined by 34 (β: -33.72; 95%CI: -68.55, 1.05). On the other hand, the mean number of patients screened for diabetes and hypertension during the pandemic increased by more than 1014 (β: 1014.5; 95%CI: 103.07, 1925.92) and 610 patients (β: 611.21; 95%CI: 302.42, 919.99), respectively. However, changes with regard to antenatal care, skilled birth delivery, and children immunization services did not show a statistically significant change after COVID-19 was reported in Ethiopia. Conclusion Despite the notable efforts to sustain essential health services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, our study revealed that there were disruptions in these services. This reinforces the need to adapt strategies to ensure sustainable provision of essential health services when pandemics of COVID19 magnitude cause disruptions of the health services.

N2  - PURPOSE: Perinatal depression significantly impacts maternal and child health, with further complexities arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review is the first to comprehensively synthesize evidence on the prevalence of perinatal depression and its associated risk factors in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) during the pandemic period. METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022326991). This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline for prevalence studies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in six databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest. Pooled prevalence estimates were computed for both prenatal and postnatal depression. Identified risk factors were summarized narratively. RESULTS: A total of 5169 studies were screened, out of which 58 were included in the narrative review and 48 [prenatal (n = 36) and postnatal (n = 17)] were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled depression prevalence for prenatal women was 23% (95% CI: 19-27%), and for the postnatal women was 23% (95% CI: 18-30%). Maternal age, education, perceived fear of COVID-19 infection, week of pregnancy, pregnancy complications, and social and family support were identified as associated risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrates an increased prevalence of perinatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. It sheds light on the significant burden faced by pregnant and postnatal women and emphasizes the necessity for targeted interventions during the ongoing and potential future crisis.

N2  - AIM: This study aimed to test the propositions using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model for main/moderation/mediation effects of a sense of coherence and practice environment support on mental well-being (anxiety, depression and burnout) outcomes in nurses and midwives in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional quantitative survey. DATA SOURCES: The study was a cross-sectional design using self-report questionnaires reported as per the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Guidelines. Following human research ethics approval (2020.ETH.00121) participants were recruited to take part in an online anonymous survey using self-report instruments to test the JD-R model in Australia. RESULTS: 156 participant nurses and midwives experienced anxiety, depression and emotional burnout during COVID-19. While a considerable proportion of participants indicated high levels of emotional exhaustion, their responses showed low levels of depersonalization (detached response to other people) and high levels of personal accomplishment (high levels of work performance and competence). A sense of coherence was a significant protective factor for mental health well-being for the participants, which is to say, high levels of sense of coherence were predictive of lower levels of anxiety, depression and burnout in this study sample. CONCLUSION: It is evident that both nursing and midwifery professions require psychosocial support to preserve their health both in the short and long term. Ensuring individualized tailored support will require a layered response within organizations aimed at individual self-care and collegial peer support. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: There was no patient or public contribution in this study, as the focus was on nurses and midwives.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Public health concerns regarding pregnant women's health after the enactment of the Cannabis Act in Canada (CAC) (a law that allowed non-medical cannabis use), and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, call for a contemporary assessment of these two events. Our study measured associations between the CAC, the COVID-19 pandemic and the monthly prevalence rates of cannabis-, all drug- and alcohol-related diagnosed disorders among pregnant women in the province of Quebec. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a quasi-experimental design applying an interrupted time-series methodology in the province of Quebec, Canada. The participants were pregnant women aged 15-49 years, between January 2010 and July 2022. MEASUREMENTS: Administrative health data from the Québec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System were used to classify pregnant women according to cannabis-, all drug (excluding cannabis)- and alcohol-related disorders. The CAC (October 2018) and the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020) were evaluated as (1) slope changes and (2) level changes. Cannabis-, all drug (excluding cannabis)- and alcohol-related disorders were measured by total monthly age-standardized monthly prevalence rate of each disorder for pregnant women aged 15-49 years. FINDINGS: Before the CAC, the prevalence rate of cannabis-related diagnosed disorders significantly increased each month by 0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-0.6] in the pregnant population. After the CAC, there were significant increases of 24% (95% CI = 1-53) of cannabis-related diagnosed disorders. No significant changes were observed for all drug (excluding cannabis)- and alcohol-related diagnosed disorders associated with the CAC. A non-significant decrease of 20% (95% CI = -38 to 3) was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in alcohol-related disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The monthly incidence rates of diagnosed cannabis-related disorders in pregnant women in Quebec increased significantly following the enactment of the Cannabis Act in Canada. Diagnoses of all drug (excluding cannabis)- and alcohol-related disorders remained relatively stable.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Black pregnant women who experience racial discrimination are at an increased risk of psychological distress. Studies have not adequately addressed if social support may moderate the association between experiences of racial discrimination and psychological distress among Black pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the moderating effect of social support on the association between experiences of racial discrimination and psychological distress among Black pregnant women. METHODS: We report findings based on cross-sectional data collected from 599 Black pregnant women enrolled in a prospective cohort study prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Women completed questionnaires about experiences of racial discrimination (Experiences of Discrimination), social support (MOS Social Support Survey), and psychological distress (Psychological General Wellbeing Index). RESULTS: Women had an average age of 26 ± 5 years and gestational age at data collection of 17 ± 6 weeks. Approximately 53% of women reported ever experiencing racial discrimination in at least one situation, and 54% reported psychological distress. After adjustment for covariates, racial discrimination was associated with a 2.2-fold increase in psychological distress (odds ratio [OR] = 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-3.70; P = .002). Low social support (scores below the median) was associated with a 3.8-fold higher likelihood of psychological distress (OR = 3.84, 95% CI 2.27-6.48, P < .001). Social support did not moderate the association of lifetime experiences of racial discrimination with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the study contribute to evidence that lifetime experiences of racial discrimination and low levels of social support relate to psychological distress among Black pregnant women.

N2  - Home visiting programs for new parents have a broad range of goals, including improvements in maternal and child health, reductions in child maltreatment, and improvements in child development. Before 2020, few home visits were conducted through phone or video encounters, i.e., telehealth home visiting (teleHV). However, rapid adoption of teleHV was required by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To understand how conducting initial visits via teleHV was associated with outcomes, we performed a secondary data analysis to make use of the natural experiment created by COVID-19. Utilizing data from the Nurse-Family Partnership, a US national evidence-based model, we compared outcomes for families whose initial home visits were in person (enrolled 10/2019 to 1/2020; n = 7066) to those whose first visits were through teleHV (enrolled 4/2020 to 12/2020; n = 14,587). TeleHV at intake was associated with a higher likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms at 12 months (OR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.07, 1.76), a lower likelihood of retention to child's age 12 months (OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.58, 0.78), a higher likelihood of early drop from the program (OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.48, 2.12), and fewer screening assessments completed (b = - 0.06; 95% CI - 0.07, - 0.04). No differences were detected between groups for the likelihood of breastfeeding at child's age 6 months, elevated intimate partner violence (IPV) risk, 90% of attempted visits completed, or time to attrition. COVID-19 may have led families in different groups to have different experiences during key points of child development; however, as both groups' involvement in the program occurred primarily during the pandemic, they were both subject to comparable influences. These findings suggest that in-person visits have some advantages in the first months of program involvement.

N2  - Background: Unplanned pregnancies increased among adolescents in Zimbabwe, resulting in unsafe abortions, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced marriages. Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) has been scanty among pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers owing to negative social norms, stigma and discrimination. This project specifically targeted pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers through a differentiated and targeted care approach to improve uptake and sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Methods: Target-specific peer support groups for pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers were established in Epworth district of Zimbabwe. The Champions of Change, a peer-based approach, was used to facilitate comprehensive sexuality education. Mentors were adolescent mothers trained on how to use a tailor-made manual to facilitate sessions. Two health centers, namely Epworth Clinic and Overspill Clinic, were purposively selected to participate in this study. A total of 60 participants were recruited into this study, 30 from each clinic. Knowledge and attitude were measured using a semi-structured questionnaire administered before and after the intervention. A scorecard was used to assess friendliness and quality of service provision. A Chi-square test of association was used to determine the significance of the change in outcomes. Results: A significant improvement in knowledge of SRHR, attitudes, and healthcare-seeking behaviors was noted. There was a significant improvement in attitudes and friendliness in service provision. Access to services significantly increased with improvements in relationships and trust. Conclusion: A targeted and differentiated care approach increases the uptake of services and health outcomes among adolescent women by addressing their unique needs and circumstances. Lay summary: Adolescent pregnancy and motherhood have significantly risen in Zimbabwe with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition of these adolescent women has been worsened by poor access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive health services by this unique group, resulting in poor sexual health outcomes. Pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers are less likely to access sexual and reproductive health services due to heightened stigma and discrimination by peers, communities and service providers themselves. We adopted a peer-based approach to increase the agency of adolescent women and empower them through comprehensive sexuality education, engaging healthcare service providers, and improving parent-child communication. With our intervention, we noted a significant improvement in the proportion of pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers accessing services and reporting improvement in relationships with parents and healthcare providers. We encourage health providers to consider providing targeted services to this group to improve uptake and health outcomes.

N2  - Background Two decades have passed since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003. Iraq has long suffered from conflicts and instability, where the people have limited access to healthcare. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought additional disruption to health service provision. Objectives At the midpoint towards universal health coverage (UHC) in 2030, this study aims to gain a better understanding of the trends of UHC progress in Iraq in the context of the conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic and to indicate possible pragmatic options. Design This study employed Bayesian hierarchical regression models to estimate trends and projections of health service availability and coverage indicators up to 2030. Furthermore, for health service coverage, four scenarios were defined based on the availability of health services, and projections were made for each scenario up to 2030. Setting Our approach used the yearly data from the Ministry of Health and four nationally representative household surveys between 2000 and 2020. We evaluated the subnational-level progress in three health service availability indicators and 13 health service coverage indicators in 18 governorates in Iraq from 2000 to 2030. Results The findings from 2000 to 2020 revealed a lack of progress in the indicators of health facility and inpatient bed, and pronounced detrimental effects from major conflicts and the pandemic on all measured health service coverage indicators. Despite these setbacks, several health service coverage indicators demonstrated resilience and elasticity in their recovery. The projected trends for 2021 to 2030 indicated limited alternations in the health service availability. By 2030, five health service coverage indicators will achieve the designated 80% targets. A scenario-based analysis predicts improved coverage of antenatal care, and child immunisation and treatment if health service availability is bolstered to globally recommended standards. Under this scenario, several governorates - Anbar, Baghdad, Nainawa, Qadissiyah, Salahaddin, Thiqar and Wasit - presented improved health service coverage in more indicators. Conclusion Strengthened health service availability has the potential to significantly improve fragile health service coverage indicators and in more vulnerable governorates.

N2  - Community engagement and local governance are important components of health interventions aiming to empower local populations. Yet, there is limited evidence on how to effectively engage with communities and codevelop interventions, especially in Southeast Asian contexts. Despite rapid progress, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) still has high maternal and child mortality, with essential service coverage showing significant disparities across socioeconomic strata. Long-standing challenges in community health were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by poor trust between users and health providers. However, the pandemic also provided an opportunity to develop approaches for enhanced community engagement and local governance capacity to tackle health inequities. The Community Network Engagement for Essential Healthcare and COVID-19 Responses through Trust (CONNECT) Initiative, developed by the Lao PDR government, WHO and partners, has resulted in initial positive outcomes in community health such as increased vaccination uptake, facility births and trust in health providers. This case study describes the iterative, adaptive process by which the CONNECT Initiative was developed, and how the core components, key stakeholders, theory of change and evaluation framework evolved from grounded observations and hypotheses. Lessons learnt include (1) awareness of entry points and existing structures to strengthen local governance for health through mutually beneficial intersectoral collaboration; (2) building relationships and trust with an adaptive, grounds-up approach for sustainability and scalability. As a model which can be adapted to other settings, this case study provides evidence on how to engage with communities, strengthen local governance and codevelop interventions towards greater health equity.

N2  - Importance: Preterm birth (PTB) (gestational age <37 weeks) is a major cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and is marked by racial and ethnic and socioeconomic inequities. Further research is needed to elucidate the association of risk and protective factors with trends in PTB rates and with related inequities. Objective: To describe the association of PTB rates with inequities as well as related risk and protective factors over the past decade in a US population-based cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of singleton live births in California from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2022, was conducted using vital statistics records and hospital records. The cohort included births with a gestational age of 22 to 44 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Preterm birth rates by racial and ethnic group and by public and nonpublic insurance (considered as a proxy for socioeconomic status) were studied across years. Log-linear regression (relative risks with 95% CIs) was used to evaluate risk and protective factors within groups. Associations of PTB rates with risk and protective factors were assessed. Results: This study included 5431018 singleton live births to individuals who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native (0.3%), Asian (14.2%), Black (4.9%), Hispanic (47.8%), or White (27.0%). A total of 43.1% of births were to individuals with public health insurance. From 2011 to 2022, the overall PTB rate increased from 6.8% to 7.5% (change [SE], 10.6% [0.6%]; z score of 18.5; P <.001). Differences in PTB rates and associated changes were observed for racial and ethnic groups and insurance groups. For example, 2022 PTB rates ranged from 5.8% among White individuals with nonpublic insurance to 11.3% among Black individuals with public health insurance. From 2011 to 2022, PTB rates decreased from 9.1% to 8.8% (change [SE], -3.5% [4.2]; z score of -0.8; P =.42) among Black individuals with nonpublic insurance, whereas they increased from 6.4% to 9.5% (change [SE], 49.8% [16.0%]; z score of 3.1; P =.002) among American Indian or Alaska Native individuals with nonpublic insurance. Increases in some risk factors (eg, preexisting diabetes, sexually transmitted infections, mental health conditions) were observed in most groups, and decreases in some protective factors (eg, participation in the California Women, Infants, and Children program) (P for trend <.001 from 2011 to 2021) were observed mostly in low-income groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of singleton live births in California, PTB rates increased in many groups. Persistent racial and ethnic and socioeconomic inequities were also observed. Changes in risk and protective factors provided clues to patterns of PTB. These data point to an urgent need to address factors associated with PTB at both the individual and population levels.

N2  - AIM: The objective of this study was to explore how selected sub-national (provincial) primary healthcare units in Ethiopia responded to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and what impact these measures had on essential health services. BACKGROUND: National-level responses against the spread of COVID-19 and its consequences are well studied. However, data on capacities and challenges of sub-national health systems in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on essential health services are limited. In countries with decentralized health systems like Ethiopia, a study of COVID-19 impacts on essential health services could inform government bodies, partners, and providers to strengthen the response against the pandemic and document lessons learned. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study, using a descriptive phenomenology research design. A total of 59 health leaders across Ethiopia's 10 regions and 2 administrative cities were purposively selected to participate in key informant interviews. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide translated into a local language. Interviews were conducted in person or by phone. Coding of transcripts led to the development of categories and themes, which were finalized upon agreement between two investigators. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Essential health services declined in the first months of the pandemic, affecting maternal and child health including deliveries, immunization, family planning services, and chronic disease services. Services declined due to patients' and providers' fear of contracting COVID-19, increased cost of transport, and reallocation of financial and human resources to the various activities of the response. Authorities of local governments and the health system responded to the pandemic immediately, capitalizing on multisectoral support and redirecting resources; however, the intensity of the response declined as time progressed. Future investments in health system hardware - health workers, supplies, equipment, and infrastructure as well as carefully designed interventions and coordination are needed to shore up the COVID-19 response.

Objective: To examine associations between prenatal exposure to the pandemic milieu and maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with rates of positive Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R) screenings. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data for this cohort study were drawn from the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) Initiative. M-CHAT-R scores obtained from children aged 16 to 30 months during routine clinical care at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City were abstracted from electronic health records (EHRs) for children born between January 2018 and September 2021 (COMBO-EHR cohort). Separately, the M-CHAT-R was administered at 18 months for children born between February 2020 and September 2021 through a prospective longitudinal study (COMBO-RSCH cohort). Prenatal pandemic exposure (birth after March 1, 2020) and maternal SARS-CoV-2 status during pregnancy was determined through EHRs. Data were analyzed from March 2022 to June 2024. Exposures: Prenatal exposures to the pandemic milieu and maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of positive M-CHAT-R screenings. For all primary analyses, unadjusted χ2 tests and adjusted logistic regression models were performed. Results: The COMBO-EHR cohort included 1664 children (442 born before the pandemic and 1222 born during the pandemic; 997 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed, 130 SARS-CoV-2 exposed, and 95 with unknown SARS-CoV-2 exposure status), of whom 266 (16.0%) were Black, 991 (59.6%) were Hispanic, 400 (24.0%) were White, 1245 (74.8%) were insured through Medicaid, 880 (52.9%) were male, and 204 (12.3%) were born prematurely. The COMBO-RSCH cohort included 385 children (74 born before the pandemic and 311 born during the pandemic; 201 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed, 101 SARS-CoV-2 exposed, and 9 with unknown SARS-CoV-2 exposure status), of whom 39 (10.1%) were Black, 168 (43.6%) were Hispanic, 157 (40.8%) were White, 161 (41.8%) were insured through Medicaid, 222 (57.7%) were male, and 38 (9.9%) were born prematurely. Prenatal pandemic exposure was not associated with a higher positive M-CHAT-R screening rate in either the COMBO-EHR or COMBO-RSCH cohort. Prenatal exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a lower rate of M-CHAT-R positivity in the COMBO-EHR cohort (12.3% [16 children] vs 24.0% [239 children]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.68; P =.001), but no association was found in the COMBO-RSCH cohort (12.9% [13 children] vs 19.9% [40 children]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24-1.04; P =.07). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 2 groups of children with prenatal pandemic exposure and/or exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, neither exposure was associated with greater M-CHAT-R positivity.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccination during pregnancy is recommended but uptake is low and evidence on the topic is limited. AIMS: This study aimed to identify the drivers of current behavior and barriers to change for health care practitioners (HCPs) and pregnant patients in Canada. METHODS: This study is an in-depth qualitative investigation of the factors influencing HCPs' vaccination communication during pregnancy, as well as factors influencing pregnant patients' vaccination uptake in Canada using the Theoretical Domains Framework. Three data sources were used: (1) perinatal HCP interviews before COVID-19; (2) perinatal HCP interviews regarding vaccine communication after COVID-19; and (3) survey of pregnant or lactating women after COVID-19. RESULTS: Forty-seven interviews and 169 participant responses were included. Perinatal HCPs reported limited information on vaccine communication or difficulty keeping up-to-date (Environmental context and resources; Knowledge; Beliefs about capabilities). HCPs lacked confidence and struggled with lack of training to address vaccine hesitancy without alienating patients (Beliefs about capabilities; Skills). Pregnant or lactating women struggled with the amount of information they felt was imposed on them, had concerns about the perceived negative consequences of vaccination, and felt pressure to understand what was best for them and their babies (Knowledge; Beliefs about consequences; Social influences). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a theory-based approach to identify influencing factors that can be mapped to theory-based intervention components, improving the likelihood of intervention effectiveness. The study is the first step in adapting an existing intervention to improve vaccine communication during pregnancy, ultimately, increasing vaccination uptake.

N2  - As the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, the clinical and public health community raced to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop life-saving vaccines. Pregnant persons were disproportionately impacted, experiencing more severe illness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. And yet, when COVID-19 vaccines became available in late 2020, safety and efficacy data were not available to inform their use during pregnancy because pregnant persons were excluded from pre-authorization clinical trials. Concerns about vaccine safety during pregnancy and misinformation linking vaccination and infertility circulated widely, creating a lack of vaccine confidence. Many pregnant people initially chose not to get vaccinated, and while vaccination rates rose after safety and effectiveness data became available, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was suboptimal and varied across racial and ethnic distribution of the pregnant population. The COVID-19 pandemic experience provided valuable insights that can inform current and future approaches to maternal vaccination against.

N2  - The U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program, which commenced in December 2020, has been instrumental in preventing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 disease. Safety monitoring has been an essential component of the program. The federal government undertook a comprehensive and coordinated approach to implement complementary safety monitoring systems and to communicate findings in a timely and transparent way to healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public. Monitoring involved both well-established and newly developed systems that relied on both spontaneous (passive) and active surveillance methods. Clinical consultation for individual cases of adverse events following vaccination was performed, and monitoring of special populations, such as pregnant persons, was conducted. This report describes the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring systems and programs used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Indian Health Service. Using the adverse event of myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination as a model, we demonstrate how the multiple, complementary monitoring systems worked to rapidly detect, assess, and verify a vaccine safety signal. In addition, longer-term follow-up was conducted to evaluate the recovery status of myocarditis cases following vaccination. Finally, the process for timely and transparent communication and dissemination of COVID-19 vaccine safety data is described, highlighting the responsiveness and robustness of the U.S. vaccine safety monitoring infrastructure during the national COVID-19 vaccination program.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with adverse effects and death among people with low immunity, including pregnant women. Despite introducing the vaccine as the proper means to curb the spread of the pandemic, vaccine uptake is still low. This study assessed the influence of perception, attitude, and trust toward COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant women attending Antenatal Care Clinics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used, utilizing a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional analytical design conducted in Mbeya urban, distribution of sample size during data collection based on client's volume at three government health facilities (one tertiary health facility, one secondary health facility, and one primary health facility) in Mbeya Urban, Tanzania. Data were collected from 333 pregnant women who attended ANC during the data collection period using a questionnaire with closed-ended questions administered to respondents face-to-face. Data cleaning and analysis were done using Excel and Stata/SE 14.1 software for bivariate and multivariate data; Pearson's chi-squire and Fisher's test were used to analyze the independent determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. RESULTS: The proportion of pregnant women vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine was 27%. There was a statistically significant association between the respondents' vaccine uptake with primary education and < 5 work experience to vaccine uptake P = 0.015 (AOR = 6.58; 95% CI; 1.45-29.85), and P = 0.046 (AOR = 2.45; 95% CI; 1.02-5.89) respectively. The association of attitude influence to COVID-19 vaccine uptake was statistically significant (acceptance of vaccine due to its availability, vaccine acceptance for protection against COVID-19 pandemic to respondent and her baby, experience from other vaccines) was statistically significant at P = 0.011 (AOR = 4.43; 95% CI; 1.41-13.93), P = 0.001 (AOR = 45.83; 95% CI; 18.6-112.89) respectively. The level of trust in the COVID-19 vaccine influenced respondents' association with vaccine uptake in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy (P = 0.633 (AOR = 1.23; 95% CI; 0.53-2.48), respectively. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women's positive attitude and trust in the COVID-19 vaccine influenced them to uptake it; our conclusion supports the WHO guidelines that the COVID-19 vaccine should be administered to pregnant women since it is a safer means to curb COVID-19 pregnancy-related complications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Elders Mentoring Program (EMP) is part of a strengths-based community-based participatory research partnership with the Cree communities of Maskwacîs, Alberta, Canada. The EMP objective is to promote maternal and child health through traditional Cree teachings and support from community Elders to pregnant women and their partners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Elders decided to shift the program to an online format in early 2021. The Elders continued to offer mentorship to program participants virtually by Zoom and telephone, and online workshops. The objective of this study was to qualitatively explore the experiences of women that took part in the virtual EMP. METHODS: We utilized qualitative description as our method, informed by our overarching community-led research partnership. Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted by Maskwacîs research assistants (RAs) with 11 women who participated in the virtual program. Interviews were conducted between December 2021 and June 2022. The participants were asked about their perceptions of the program and its benefits. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded by four RAs using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although cultural teachings are traditionally offered in person, the shift to the virtual platform was greatly appreciated by all the women. Technology can be a useful tool for cultural teachings and language to be shared among community members when they cannot be physically together. Four main themes emerged from the data, representing the participants' experiences, and learning through their interactions with the Elders from the EMP. The themes are: Ohpikihâwasowin (grounding and guiding on the path to be a healthy parent); Indigenous ways of healing; On the path of cultural learning; and Identity for self and baby. CONCLUSION: The virtual adaptation of the EMP allowed a space for Elders to offer support to women living in and out of the community to provide guidance with their pregnancies and into motherhood. The workshops and one-on-one calls allowed for cultural revitalization which is critical for Indigenous well-being. All the participants found that the teachings and interactions positively impacted their pregnancy and parenthood. Overall, the virtual program demonstrated a venue for intergenerational healing and resilience.

N2  - Background: Child health programmes in the United Kingdom offer every child and their family an evidence-based programme to support child health and development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health visiting services in many areas were reduced to a partial service, with significant variability between and within the four United Kingdom countries. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on health visiting services and developed recommendations for policy and practice. Objectives: Conduct a realist review of relevant literature. Engage with key stakeholders in policy, practice and research across the United Kingdom. Identify recommendations for improving the organisation and delivery of health visiting services, with a focus on services being equitable, effective and efficient. Review methods: The realist review followed Pawson's five iterative steps and involved key stakeholder representatives at every step. We searched five electronic databases and references of included articles, as well as relevant organisational websites, to find quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods and grey literature related to health visiting services in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of their relevance to our initial programme theory determined inclusion in the review. Data were extracted, organised and presented as draft context, mechanism and outcome configurations. These were iteratively refined through meetings with 6 people with lived experience of caring for babies during the pandemic and 23 professional stakeholders. Context, mechanism and outcome configurations were then translated into findings and recommendations. Results: One hundred and eighteen documents contributed to the review and collectively revealed the far-reaching, uneven and enduring impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on babies and families. Data uncovered significant concerns of families and practitioners amidst the pandemic, along with the service's corresponding actions. These concerns and responses underscored the critical importance of fostering and sustaining trusting relationships between health visitors and families, as well as conducting holistic assessments for early intervention. Although we found minimal evidence of decision-making within organisational/managerial levels, the data illustrated the diverse and complex nature of health visiting work and the need for flexibility and resourcefulness. Limitations: The primary limitation of this review was a lack of specific evidence from the United Kingdom nations other than England. There was also a lack of data focusing on changes during the COVID-19 pandemic at a local management level. Conclusions: The needs of babies, children and families, and the delivery of services to support them, were not prioritised in the early phase of the pandemic response. Our data show that the health visiting service was concerned with maintaining visibility of all children, and especially supporting families with a new baby. Health visiting services adapted in numerous ways to respond to these concerns. Implications for policy and practice are presented, identified from our analysis and discussions with stakeholders. Future work: The RReHOPE study is part of a jigsaw of evidence, which will provide a much stronger evidence base for future policy and practice. This realist review presents several areas for future research, including how health visiting is organised at local management level; how to optimise limited resources; factors affecting differing uptake in different regions; and analysis of the effectiveness of health visiting using large cohort studies. Funding: This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme under award number NIHR134986.

N2  - Background and ObjectivesDe novo gain-of-function variants in the CACNA1D gene, encoding the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV1.3, cause a multifaceted syndrome. Patients show variable degrees of autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, epilepsy, and other neurologic and endocrine abnormalities (primary aldosteronism and/or hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia). We study here a novel variant [c.3506G>A, NM_000720.4, p.(G1169D)] in 2 children with the same CACNA1D mutation but different disease severity.MethodsThe clinical data of the study patients were collected. After molecular analysis and cloning by site-directed mutagenesis, patch-clamp recordings of transfected tsA201 cells were conducted in whole-cell configuration. The functional effects of wild-type and mutated channels were analyzed.ResultsOne child is a severely affected boy with a novel de novo CACNA1D variant with additional clinical symptoms including prenatal-onset tremor, congenital respiratory insufficiency requiring continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, and sensorineural deafness. Despite episodes of hypoglycemia, insulin levels were normal. Aldosterone:renin ratios as a screening parameter for primary aldosteronism were variable. In the second patient, putative mosaicism of the p.(G1169D) variant was associated with a less severe phenotype. Patch-clamp electrophysiology of the p.(G1169D) variant in a heterologous expression system revealed pronounced activity-enhancing gating changes, including a shift of channel activation and inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials, as well as impaired channel inactivation and deactivation. Despite retained sensitivity to the Ca2+ channel blocker isradipine in vitro, no beneficial effects of isradipine or nifedipine treatment were observed in the index case.DiscussionThrough this report, we expand the knowledge about the disease presentation in patients with CACNA1D variants and show the novel variant's modulatory effects on CaV1.3 gating.

N2  - Background: Health workers' (HWs') perspectives on the quality of maternal and newborn care (QMNC) are not routinely collected. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to document HWs' perspectives on QMNC around childbirth in 12 World Health Organization (WHO) European countries. Methods: HWs involved in maternal/neonatal care for at least one year between March 2020 and March 2023 answered an online validated WHO standards-based questionnaire collecting 40 quality measures for improving QMNC. A QMNC index (score 0-400) was calculated as a synthetic measure. Results: Data from 4143 respondents were analysed. For 39 out of 40 quality measures, at least 20% of HWs reported a 'need for improvement', with large variations across countries. Effective training on healthy women/newborns management (n = 2748, 66.3%), availability of informed consent job aids (n = 2770, 66.9%), and effective training on women/newborns rights (n = 2714, 65.5%) presented the highest proportion of HWs stating 'need for improvement'. Overall, 64.8% (n = 2684) of respondents declared that HWs' numbers were insufficient for appropriate care (66.3% in Portugal and 86.6% in Poland), and 22.4% described staff censorship (16.3% in Germany and 56.7% in Poland). The reported QMNC index was low in all countries (Poland median (MD) = 210.60, interquartile range (IQR) = 155.71, 273.57; Norway MD = 277.86; IQR = 244.32, 308.30). The 'experience of care' domain presented in eight countries had significantly lower scores than the other domains (P < 0.001). Over time, there was a significant monthly linear decrease in the QMNC index (P < 0.001), lacking correlation with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic trends (P > 0.05). Multivariate analyses confirmed large QMNC variation by country. HWs with <10 years of experience, HWs from public facilities, and midwives rated QMNC with significantly lower scores (P < 0.001). Conclusions: HWs from 12 European countries reported significant gaps in QMNC, lacking association with COVID-19 pandemic trends. Routine monitoring of QMNC and tailored actions are needed to improve health services for the benefit of both users and providers. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04847336.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to specifically investigate Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD), as one of the noteworthy disorders within the spectrum of anxiety disorders, among children and adolescents, after overcoming the crises caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Efforts were also made to identify socio-demographic factors that could be associated with changes in SAD level and also to assess the effect of different constituting dimensions of SAD on the severity of this disorder. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, face-to-face interviews were conducted with the parents of 317 (7-13-year-old) Iranian students, who were selected through a multi-stage random sampling method in the city of Shiraz. During the interviews, socio-demographic data were collected, and subsequently, SAD symptoms and dimensions were assessed using the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale (Parent Version) (SAAS-P) questionnaire. Later, employing the Partition Around Medoids (PAM) statistical method, the participants were categorized into two groups with low and high levels of SAD. Also, to understand the interaction between the different dimensions of SAD, the network analysis method was employed. Finally, univariate analysis and logistic regression were utilized, with a significance level of 0.05, to determine potential associating factors with the level of SAD. RESULTS: The sample included 128 girls and 189 boys with a mean age of 9.63 ± 2.63 and 9.63 ± 1.95 years respectively. Based on the PAM method, 51.1% of the participants presented a high level of SAD. According to network analysis, it was demonstrated that the "fear of abandonment" dimension plays a central role in high levels of SAD. Based on logistic regression, female gender, age ≥ 10 years, parents' unacademic educational background, mother's employment, and child's history of physical/mental problems were significantly associated with the high level of SAD. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of the participants in this study presented a high level of SAD with the "fear of abandonment" being a key influential dimension of elevated levels of this disorder. Maternal employment, female gender, child's history of health issues, and low parental education were identified as important contributors to the high SAD level. Considering these factors allows for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. However, the need for further studies remains crucial.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are many factors effective on occurrence of post-partum anxiety and depression. COVID-19 pandemic, as a major health crisis, affected many countries and had undesirable mental health outcomes, especially for the vulnerable population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of post-partum anxiety and depression and their related factors during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The present descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 360 mothers who delivered their child during COVID-19 pandemic and had referred to the comprehensive urban health canter of Lenjan city two months after their delivery (from November 10th, 2021, until March 19th, 2022). Data were gathered using 3 questionnaires including demographic characteristics, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24 and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and post-partum depression was 27% and 20%, respectively. None of the demographic characteristics had a significant relationship with anxiety and depression. Related factors to post-partum anxiety included desired pregnancy, premenstrual syndrome, marital conflicts, history of mother's hospitalization due to COVID-19, compliance rate with preventive health measures for COVID-19, stressful events, and social support. CONCLUSION: It is suggested to screen mothers to detect significant related factors of post-partum anxiety and depression in other future pandemics or epidemics to support them.

N2  - Importance: Population-based analyses provided divergent data on the changes in preterm birth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is a gap of knowledge on the variations in birth characteristics. Objective: To study changes in perinatal care, causes of preterm delivery, and very preterm (VPT; defined as <32 weeks' gestation) birth rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-level cohort study used data from the quality assurance registry, which covers all births in Hesse, Germany. Deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) were compared with the corresponding grouped prepandemic time intervals (2017 to 2019). Analyses were executed between August 2023 and July 2024. Exposures: Analyses were directed to study differences in preterm births before and during 3 pandemic phases: first (March 14 to May 15, 2020) and second (October 19 to December 31, 2020) lockdowns and a period of less-vigorous restrictions between them (May 16 to October 18, 2020). Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes of interest were variations in preterm birth rates in the context of baseline characteristics and causes of preterm births during vs before the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: From the total cohort of 184 827 births from 2017 to 2020, 719 stillbirths occurred and 184 108 infants were liveborn. Compared with the prepandemic period, medical care characteristics did not differ during the COVID-19 period. The odds of VPT births were lower during the pandemic period (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) compared with the prepandemic period, with the greatest reduction observed during the second lockdown period (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.84). Reduction in VPT births was attributed to fewer births in pregnancies among individuals with a history of serious disease (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.83), pathologic cardiotocography (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.82), and intrauterine infection (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92) while incidences of history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancies, serious or severe psychological distress, and preeclampsia, eclampsia, or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome as cause for preterm delivery remained unchanged. Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study on the COVID-19 pandemic and preterm birth rates, the duration of exposure to mitigation measures during pregnancy was associated with accelerated reductions in preterm births. The findings of lower rates of baseline risks and causes of preterm deliveries support efforts to intensify health care prevention programs during pregnancy to reduce the preterm birth burden. These findings of this study put particular focus on hygiene measures to reduce the rate of deliveries for intrauterine infection and highlight the potential of expanding strategies to the different risks and causes of preterm delivery.

N2  - Depression, a pervasive and debilitating mental health disorder, affects millions of individuals worldwide, cutting across age, gender, and socioeconomic boundaries. The review begins with an overview of the global prevalence and incidence of depression, highlighting demographic variations and the significant impact of recent global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on mental health. It then systematically examines the clinical definitions and classifications of depression, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and other subtypes, guided by diagnostic criteria from DSM-5 and ICD-11. The multifactorial etiology of depression is dissected into biological, psychological, and environmental contributors, emphasizing the interplay of genetic predispositions, neurotransmitter imbalances, cognitive theories, personality traits, and socio-environmental stressors. The review further explores the extensive spectrum of depression's impact, from emotional and psychological disturbances to physical symptoms and functional impairments in daily life, relationships, and comorbid mental health conditions. The challenges in diagnosing depression, the critical role of clinical interviews, psychometric tools, and the importance of distinguishing depression from other disorders are addressed. Treatment approaches are comprehensively analyzed, encompassing pharmacological therapies, psychotherapy, lifestyle interventions, complementary and alternative therapies, and emerging treatments such as ketamine therapy, TMS, and psychedelics. The review also discusses the pervasive challenges in treating depression, including stigma, accessibility, treatment adherence, and the risk of relapse. This extensive exploration underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of depression and a multifaceted approach to its treatment, paving the way for more effective, personalized, and accessible mental health care.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal health disparities based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors exist in the United States, with Black women experiencing significantly worse outcomes. With much of perinatal morbidity and mortality attributed to the postpartum period, attention to equitable postpartum care is necessary for addressing this disparity. Process: A rapid-cycle quality improvement initiative was implemented in an urban clinic serving predominantly Black, Medicaid-insured clients. Although baseline data indicated 95% of clients experienced comorbidities, only 65% attended a comprehensive postpartum visit (PPV). The project's goal was to improve equitable postpartum care by increasing PPV attendance and quality of postpartum care to 90% in 8 weeks. The clinical team was engaged throughout to promote organizational change within the clinic. A provider checklist was implemented to improve PPV care metrics, and shared decision-making was initiated surrounding contraception and mood disorders. A care log tracked clinical practice guideline adherence with regular feedback informing the change process. Outcomes: Postpartum care improved across a variety of factors studied over 8 weeks. The provider checklist prompted a 78% documentation rate of PPV care metrics, and care log tracking reflected an ending PPV attendance rate of 93%. Client satisfaction with postpartum care education was measured using a Likert scale of 1 to 5 (1 = dissatisfied and 5 = satisfied) with a noted improvement from a baseline score of 4.3 to an overall mean of 4.8. Discussion: This quality initiative addressed a key factor in health equity for a predominantly Black, Medicaid-insured population in an urban clinic by raising PPV attendance rates above national standards of 90% and improving client satisfaction and the quality of care received during these visits. The project was low cost and created sustainable systems for maintaining evidence-based equitable care. Limitations included the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic, clinic staff turnover, and staff and client biases. Continued innovative research targeted at improving health equity is needed.

N2  - Background: Maternal mortality ratio is one of the significant indicators of a country's healthcare quality and development. In recent years, Türkiye has made significant advancements in maternal and child health services. However, it has been discussed that stagnation has been observed in recent years, and the migration from Syria and the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly overshadowed this success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current situation of the maternal mortality level in the country based on the experiences and views of experts working in this area. Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of academics, representatives of public institutions, and NGOs to understand the mechanisms of success in maternal mortality in the 1990s. Thematic analysis was used to understand the reasons for the stagnation of the decline in maternal mortality and to develop recommendations for reducing maternal mortality. Results: Twenty-five key informant interviews were conducted. Positive developments contributing to the success of maternal mortality, problems and obstacles hindering further progress and suggestions/recommendations are the themes of this research. The key informants highlighted the health transformation policies, the lack of data on the impact of COVID-19, recent migration on maternal mortality, inadequate education and training on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), the absence of rights-based policies, and gender equality as critical issues in current policies. Conclusion: The outcomes of this study underline the importance of the availability, accessibility, and quality of SRH services and empowering women, girls, families, and communities to eliminate preventable maternal mortality levels.

N2  - The first 1000 days of life is a critical period of development in which adverse circumstances can have long-term consequences for the child’s health. Maternal immune activation is associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the child. Aberrant immune responses have been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, lasting effects of maternal immune activation on the offspring’s immune system have been reported. Taken together, this indicates that the effect of maternal immune activation is not limited to the central nervous system. Here, we explore the impact of maternal immune activation on the immune system of the offspring. We first describe the development of the immune system and provide an overview of reported alterations in the cytokine profiles, immune cell profiles, immune cell function, and immune induction in pre-clinical models. Additionally, we highlight recent research on the impact of maternal COVID-19 exposure on the neonatal immune system and the potential health consequences for the child. Our review shows that maternal immune activation alters the offspring’s immune system under certain conditions, but the reported effects are conflicting and inconsistent. In general, epigenetic modifications are considered the mechanism for fetal programming. The available data was insufficient to identify specific pathways that may contribute to immune programming. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more research now focuses on the possible health effects of maternal immune activation on the offspring. Future research addressing the offspring’s immune response to maternal immune activation can elucidate specific pathways that contribute to fetal immune programming and the long-term health effects for the offspring.

N2  - Aim: This study aims to evaluate the risk conditions for postpartum depression in mothers who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify the factors influencing these conditions. Methods: A total of 642 mothers who gave birth between March 10 and May 15, 2020, were included. Data were collected through phone interviews using a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Participants were categorized into risky and non-risky groups based on their Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores. Statistical analyses, including student-t tests, Mann–Whitney U tests, and Pearson/Spearman correlation analyses, were performed using SPSS version 22.0. Results: The mean age of participants was 29.93±5.03 years. The prevalence of postpartum depression risk was 14.5%. Statistically significant correlations were found between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores and factors such as educational background, history of mental illness in the family or self, birth week, delivery method, and postpartum follow-up attendance. High-risk factors included higher education, employment, higher income, cesarean section delivery, preterm birth, and feelings of inadequacy in baby care. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of postpartum depression. Early diagnosis and initiating treatment in mothers prone to postpartum depression can minimize negative outcomes. Identifying risk factors facilitates close follow-up and targeted preventive measures, underscoring the critical role of comprehensive care approaches in family medicine, especially during global health crises.

N2  - Maternal vaccination during pregnancy, in general and against COVID-19 infection, offers protection to both mother and baby, but uptake remains suboptimal. This study aimed to explore the perceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, particularly for marginalised populations and those living with social or medical complexity. A total of 96 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 women, 15 partners, 21 HCPs, and 20 policy makers, across all four nations of the United Kingdom (UK), discussing their lived experience of utilising, delivering, or developing policy for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy during the pandemic. Three themes were derived: (1) historical and social context, (2) communication of information and guidance, and (3) appraisal and action. Together these captured the participants’ legacy of mistrust in drugs during pregnancy; prior positive experiences; concerns about missing information, conflicting information, or false information about COVID-19 vaccines; and confusing guidance for pregnant women. The final theme describes the participants’ behaviour and actions undertaken consequent to their experiences and the available information. The findings suggest efforts to improve COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy may be best focused on personalised communication of information. A trusting relationship and prior positive experiences with other vaccines, both in and outside of pregnancy, positively influenced perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination.

N2  - Background: The timely management of rapidly evolving epidemiological scenarios caused by disease outbreaks is crucial to prevent devastating consequences. However, delayed laboratory diagnostics can hamper swift health policy and epidemic response, especially in remote regions such as the western Brazilian Amazon. The aim of the article is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volume and characteristics of emergency medical services (EMS) in Manaus, focusing on how the pandemic affected sensitive indicators such as response time and the use of advanced life support ambulances. Additionally, the study seeks to understand how changes in prehospital EMS patterns, triggered by the pandemic, could be utilized as health surveillance tools, enabling a more rapid response in epidemic scenarios. Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study included data from the SAMU (Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência) medical records between January and June 2020. Results: A total of 45,581 calls resulted in mobile units being dispatched during this period. These patients were predominantly male (28,227, 61.9%), with a median age of 47 years (IQR 30–67). The median response time significantly increased during the pandemic, reaching a median of 45.9 min (IQR 30.6–67.7) (p < 0.001). EMS calls were reduced for trauma patients and increased for other medical emergencies, especially respiratory conditions, concomitantly to an escalation in the number of deaths caused by SARS and COVID-19 (p < 0.001). The employment of advanced life support ambulances was higher during the pandemic phase (p = 0.0007). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary disorder in the volume and reason for EMS calls in Manaus. Consequently, sensitive indicators like the response time and the employment of advanced life support ambulances were negatively affected. Sudden prehospital EMS pattern changes could play an important role in health surveillance systems, allowing for earlier establishment of countermeasures in epidemics. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prehospital EMS and its role in health surveillance should be further explored.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Women of childbearing age not only reside in agricultural communities but also form an integral part of the agricultural labor force. Limited research investigates the impact of prenatal fungicide exposure on infant health, specifically ethylenebisdithiocarbamates and their toxic by-product, ethylenethiourea (ETU), particularly in occupational settings. This paper describes the background, aims, protocol, and baseline sample characteristics for the SEMILLA study, which investigates prenatal ETU exposure, neonatal thyroid function, infant growth, and neurobehavioral development in an agricultural region of Ecuador. Methods: This cohort study follows pregnant women and their infants up to 18 months of age, incorporating urinary biomarkers and survey data on ETU exposure and infant growth and neurodevelopmental measures. Data collection includes detailed questionnaires, scales, and physical examinations on maternal and infant health and development, as well as environmental factors. Descriptive statistics on key characteristics of the study population at baseline are presented. Results: SEMILLA enrolled 409 participants (72% enrollment rate): 111 agricultural workers (mostly floricultural), 149 non-agricultural workers, and 149 non-workers. Baseline characteristics show comparability between work sector groups, with some economic differences. Conclusions: SEMILLA will provide key evidence on prenatal fungicide exposure and infant development and encompass comprehensive multistage data collection procedures in pregnancy and infancy, focusing on structural and social determinants of health as well as individual-level chemical exposures. The community-based approach has proven essential, even amid challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. The medium-term objective is to inform sustainable interventions promoting maternal and child health, with a long-term goal to reduce community exposures and improve worker health policies, particularly for women and pregnant workers.

N2  - BACKGROUND | Individuals who have gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are advised to engage in physical activity and healthy eating behaviors in the postpartum period to prevent type 2 diabetes. We aimed to understand individual perspectives on incorporating such lifestyle choices during the first postpartum year. METHODS | This was a mixed-methods analysis of data from individuals with GDM who completed surveys and in-depth interviews at 4–12 weeks and 11–13 months postpartum as part of their participation in a feasibility randomized controlled trial on postpartum patient navigation. Participant attitudes were elicited with surveys (structured items with Likert-scale responses) and interviews that focused on barriers to postpartum type 2 diabetes prevention. We used a concurrent, triangulation design to jointly analyze survey data alongside interview data. RESULTS | Of 40 participants, 39 provided data about their type 2 diabetes prevention activities. Interview themes trian-gulated with survey results to yield consistent insights about attitudes regarding physical activity and healthy eating. The majority of participants reported that caring for a new baby and family responsibilities made it much harder to be physically active; fewer participants identified cost of exercise, accessing a safe area to exercise, or breastfeeding as barriers. The most common barriers to healthy eating included caring for a new baby, family responsibilities, and work/ school schedules. Although proximity and transportation to healthy food sources were uncommon barriers, when they did occur, they were experienced as major burdens. CONCLUSION | Individuals who had GDM reported many barriers to implementing recommended postpartum lifestyle choices. Recognizing these unique needs may enhance provision of guidance for type 2 diabetes prevention postpartum.

N2  - Background & objectives: The expanded programme on immunization launched in India in 1978, with its focus on preventing six diseases in children (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, typhoid, and childhood tuberculosis), was widened in its scope in 1985-86. This new avtaar, the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), incorporated measles vaccine for children and rubella and adult diphtheria vaccines for pregnant women. We conducted this rapid review on adult immunization relevant for India, as recent COVID-19 experience revealed how newly emergent or re-emergent pathogens could have their onslaughts on the elderly and adults with comorbidities. Methods: Three different bibliographic databases, namely PubMed, Scopus and Ovid were searched electronically to access the articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Relevant consensus guidelines by in-country professional groups were also collated. We conducted deduplication and screening of the outputs of these searches (1242 bibliographical records). Finally, 250 articles were found eligible for inclusion. As trials on the reduction of morbidities, mortalities and hospitalizations in adults due to proposed vaccines under Indian consensus guidelines were not available, no meta-analysis was conducted. Results: Evidence from articles finally included in this synthesis were grouped under (i) preventing viral and bacterial infections in adults; (ii) adult vaccination and awareness tools; (iii) vaccine hesitancy/ acceptance; and (iv) adult vaccination guidelines. In-country research revealed the need for introducing the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in adolescence or early-adulthood to prevent ano-genital cancers in elderly and later life. Importantly HPV prevalence among cervical cancer patients varied between 88 to 98 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Delhi. The importance of conducting regular surveillance of pneumococcal diseases and influenza, as well as tweaking the vaccines accordingly, was revealed in other articles. A poor uptake of influenza vaccine (≤2%) in adults (≥45 yr) was documented. The uptake of hepatitis B vaccine in Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Delhi and Mumbai was of concern and ranged from 55 to 64 per cent. The vulnerability of HCWs to rubella was investigated in a paediatric ophthalmic hospital in Madurai: a tenth of the selected HCWs were rubella seronegative and mounted good protective immunity following RA 27/3 vaccine administration. An outbreak of measles in college students in Pune emphasized the phenomenon of waning immunity. Similarly, a study in the infectious disease hospital in Kolkata and in-patients in Delhi revealed a lack of protective immunity against diphtheria and tetanus in adults. The researchers estimated the economic benefits of providing a typhoid vaccine to a household to be US$ 23 in a middle-income neighbourhood and US$ 14 in slum settings. The authors highlighted the importance of preventive strategies, finding that the cost of severe typhoid fever was US$ 119.1 in 18 centres across India. Both qualitative and quantitative investigations explored vaccine hesitancy, which was studied more during the COVID-19 pandemic than earlier. Interpretation & conclusions: Vaccination programmes in India would require (i) increasing awareness around vaccine-preventable diseases among adults and HCWs; (ii) actively engaging health care systems and community-based organizations; and (iii) developing and producing affordable, safe, and country-appropriate vaccines. Effective communication strategies and tools will be the key to the success of such interventions.

N2  - Background/Objective: We present an adolescent male with Noonan syndrome (NS) and celiac disease (CD) who attained normal adult height with growth hormone (GH) treatment and gluten-free diet (GFD). Case Report: A 15 ½ year old healthy male presented with short stature and delayed puberty. His mother and maternal grandmother were short with heights 142.2 cm and 147.3 cm, respectively. Examination showed bilateral epicanthal folds and down slanting eyes like his mother, fifth finger clinodactyly, height 147.5 cm (<1%; standard deviation score, −2.96), growth velocity 2.5 cm/y, weight 48.2 kg (11%; standard deviation score, −1.24), Tanner 2 pubic hair and Tanner 1 genitalia. Midparental target height was 169.1 cm. He had normal screening studies for GH deficiency and thyroid disorders, prepubertal gonadotropins and testosterone levels, and normal total immunoglobulin A, and elevated antitissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A 134.7units/mL (0-20). Bone age was 13 years. Genetic evaluation revealed heterozygous missense variant of BRAF gene in him and his mother confirming a diagnosis of NS. He was diagnosed with CD by intestinal biopsy. Patient was started on GH therapy and a GFD with subsequent improvement in growth velocit (6.8-12.3 cm/y) and advancement of puberty. The patient stopped GH therapy at 17 ½ years with a height 165.9 cm. Discussion: Coexistence of NS caused by BRAF missense variant and CD has not been previously reported. Our patient attained normal adult height with GH therapy and GFD. Conclusion: NS and CD can co-occur and addressing both these disorders can help patients attain normal height potential.

N2  - Mounting evidence indicates the worsening of maternal mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health conditions are the leading cause of preventable death during the perinatal and postpartum periods. Our study sought to detect space-time patterns in the distribution of maternal mental health conditions in pregnant women before (2016–2019) and during (2020–2021) the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina, USA. Using the space-time Poisson model in SaTScan, we performed univariate and multivariate cluster analysis of emergency department (ED) visits for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), severe mental illness (SMI), maternal mental disorders of pregnancy (MDP), suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts during the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Clusters were adjusted for age, race, and insurance type. Significant multivariate and univariate PMAD, SMI, and MDP clustering persisted across both periods in North Carolina, while univariate clustering for both suicide outcomes decreased during the pandemic. Local relative risk (RR) for all conditions increased drastically in select locations. The number of zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) included in clusters decreased, while the proportion of urban locations included in clusters increased for non-suicide outcomes. Average yearly case counts for all maternal mental health outcomes increased during the pandemic. Results provide contextual and spatial information concerning at-risk maternal populations with a high burden of perinatal mental health disorders before and during the pandemic and emphasize the necessity of urgent and targeted expansion of mental health resources in select communities.

N2  - Problem: Families living in rural communities need to relocate, be transferred or travel long distances to access specialist maternal and neonatal care, leading to isolation from their support networks. Background: High-risk maternal and neonatal complexities in rural maternity units results in more transfers and retrievals to metropolitan services. There is limited understanding of the physical and psychological impacts for women and their families when they are transferred or displaced from their rural communities during pregnancy. Aim: To investigate the lived experience of relocation for specialist pregnancy, birthing, postnatal and neonatal care on women and families. Methods: Women (n=5) and partners (n=4) from rural South Australia, participated in semi-structured interviews on their experiences of transfer from local maternity providers. Couples interviewed together, interactions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed to identify overarching and sub-themes. Findings: The overarching theme was ‘mismatched expectations’, with three identified sub-themes: ‘communication’, ‘compassion’ and ‘safety’. Discrepancies between expectations and realities during relocation left participants feeling isolated, alone and needing to self-advocate during this vulnerable period. Despite receiving specialist care, women and partners encountered unique hardships when separated from their rural community. Their social needs were poorly understood and seldom addressed in specialist units, resulting in poor experiences. Discussion: Consideration regarding the impact of attending specialist maternity services for women and partners from rural areas is required. The ‘one size fits all’ approach for maternity care is unrealistic and research is needed to improve the experiences for those uprooted from rural communities for higher levels of care.

N2  - Objective: To describe the Coronovirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic impact among mothers of young children (0–8 years) and assess prepandemic factors associated with greater pandemic impact and psychosocial distress. Methods: Mothers from 3 US birth cohorts (n = 301, mean child age 2.4 years) reported on demographics and psychosocial distress (anxiety, perceived stress, financial stress) before the pandemic (February 2015–February 2020). During the pandemic (July 2020–June 2021), they completed a supplemental survey about the impact of the pandemic on their families (Coronavirus Impact Scale) and psychosocial distress. Multivariable linear and ordinal logistic regression were used to evaluate prepandemic factors associated with pandemic impact overall and by domain. Results: Compared to prepandemic reports, maternal anxiety symptoms increased by 9.4%, perceived stress increased by 13.3%, and financial stress increased by 41.7%, of which all were statistically significant changes. Participants reported the most severe pandemic impact in family routines (72.4%), experiences of stress (40.2%), and social support (38.6%). Mothers with some college or a 4-year degree experienced higher overall pandemic impact compared to mothers with the least and highest education. Prepandemic distress was not associated with pandemic impact; however, midpandemic, all 3 distress measures were significantly positively associated with overall Coronavirus Impact Scale, with the largest effect size noted for perceived stress (B = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.90,1.82). Conclusions: While, on average, mothers of young children experienced worsening psychosocial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, prepandemic psychosocial stress alone was not prospectively associated with greater pandemic impact, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic may have both elaborated existing systemic social inequalities and created new burdens.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To estimate the prevalence of post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) after infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and to characterize associated risk factors.METHODS:In a multicenter cohort study (NIH RECOVER [Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery]-Pregnancy Cohort), individuals who were pregnant during their first SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled across the United States from December 2021 to September 2023, either within 30 days of their infection or at differential time points thereafter. The primary outcome was PASC, defined as score of 12 or higher based on symptoms and severity as previously published by the NIH RECOVER-Adult Cohort, at the first study visit at least 6 months after the participant's first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Risk factors for PASC were evaluated, including sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics before SARS-CoV-2 infection (baseline comorbidities, trimester of infection, vaccination status), and acute infection severity (classified by need for oxygen therapy). Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate associations between these characteristics and presence of PASC.RESULTS:Of the 1,502 participants, 61.1% had their first SARS-CoV-2 infection on or after December 1, 2021 (ie, during Omicron variant dominance); 51.4% were fully vaccinated before infection; and 182 (12.1%) were enrolled within 30 days of their acute infection. The prevalence of PASC was 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9-10.9%) measured at a median of 10.3 months (interquartile range 6.1-21.5) after first infection. The most common symptoms among individuals with PASC were postexertional malaise (77.7%), fatigue (76.3%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (61.2%). In a multivariable model, the proportion PASC positive with vs without history of obesity (14.9% vs 7.5%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.65, 95% CI, 1.12-2.43), depression or anxiety disorder (14.4% vs 6.1%, aOR 2.64, 95% CI, 1.79-3.88) before first infection, economic hardship (self-reported difficulty covering expenses) (12.5% vs 6.9%, aOR 1.57, 95% CI, 1.05-2.34), and treatment with oxygen during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (18.1% vs 8.7%, aOR 1.86, 95% CI, 1.00-3.44) were associated with increased prevalence of PASC.CONCLUSION:The prevalence of PASC at a median time of 10.3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was 9.3% in the NIH RECOVER-Pregnancy Cohort. The predominant symptoms were postexertional malaise, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Several socioeconomic and clinical characteristics were associated with PASC after infection during pregnancy.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05172024.

N2  - Background: Despite broad COVID-19 vaccination coverage in India, hesitancy persists, limiting the achievement of 100 % vaccination coverage across the country to prevent the ongoing transmission of the infection. We explored the key drivers of vaccine hesitancy among unvaccinated adults in semi-urban regions of Kerala, India. Method: ology: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted from April to May 2022, using purposive sampling to enroll participants with the help of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers. Participation in the interviews was voluntary and was conducted at the participant's residence at a time convenient for the participants. Audio files of the interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the anonymized data underwent a multistage thematic analysis using the constant comparative method. Results: In our study with 35 unvaccinated individuals were interviewed. Identified factors for vaccine hesitancy were categorized into different themes: individual factors (35 %), vaccine-related factors (33.33 %), and social/environmental factors (31.67 %). Conclusions: Targeted communication strategies and behavioural change interventions need be employed to mitigate major drivers of vaccine hesitancy. Addressing vaccine hesitancy requires multifaceted strategies including community engagement, collaboration with alternative medical systems, healthcare worker education, prioritizing vulnerable populations, and transparent communication about vaccine safety and adverse events. Implementing these measures will help overcome barriers and enhance vaccine coverage.

N2  - The first hours, days, and weeks following childbirth are critical for the well-being of both the mother and newborn. Despite this significance, the postnatal period often receives inadequate attention in terms of quality care provision. In Nepal, the utilization of postnatal care (PNC) services remains a challenging issue. Employing a facility-based concurrent triangulation mixed-method approach, this study aimed to identify factors associated with PNC service utilization, as well as its facilitators and barriers. A quantitative survey involved 243 mothers who had given birth in the six months preceding the survey, selected using a multistage sampling technique from six health facilities of two randomly selected local levels of the Pyuthan district. Weighted multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of PNC service utilization. Additionally, qualitative analysis using Braun and Clarke’s six-step thematic analysis elucidated facilitators and barriers. The study revealed a weighted prevalence of PNC service utilization as per protocol at 38.43% (95% CI: 32.48–44.74). Notably, Socioeconomic status (AOR-3.84, 95% CI: 2.40–6.15), place of delivery (AOR-1.86, 95% CI: 1.16–3.00), possessing knowledge of postnatal care (AOR = 6.75, 95% CI: 3.39–13.45) and access to a motorable road (AOR = 6.30, 95% CI: 3.94–10.08) were identified as predictors of PNC service utilization. Triangulation revealed knowledge on PNC, transportation facilities, PNC home visits, and postpartum weaknesses to visit health facility as areas of convergence. Conversely, divergent areas included the proximity of health facilities and the effect of COVID-19. The study identified a low prevalence of PNC service utilization in the district. To enhance utilization, targeted interventions to increase awareness about postnatal care, appropriate revision of existing policies, addressing wider determinants of service utilization, and ensuring effective implementation of PNC home-visit programs are of utmost importance.

N2  - Background Due to changes in Swedish maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, partners were often excluded from antenatal and postnatal care. Aim To explore partners’ experiences of pregnancy, labour, and postnatal care in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Methods A descriptive qualitative interview study with 15 partners of women who gave birth from March 2020 to March 2022. Data was collected from April to November 2022, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings Two themes and six subthemes were identified. The first theme, Feelings of loss and exclusion, emphasises the expectation and desire to share the journey of becoming a parent together with the pregnant partner. When excluded from maternity care, a feeling of missing out was described which could create a sense of distance from the unborn child. The second theme, Dealing with powerlessness, relates to the fear of infection and not being able to participate during the birth, and life being adapted to restrictions. Mixed feelings regarding the restrictions were described since the reasons behind were not always perceived as clear and logical. Discussion Sweden prides itself on gender equality, where partners normally are a natural part of maternity care. This likely contributed to strong feelings of exclusion when partners were prevented from participating in maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Partners of women giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic were substantially affected by the restrictions within maternity care. Partners wish to be involved in pregnancy and birth and want to receive clear information as part of their preparation for parenthood. Society–including maternity care–must decide how to address these needs.

N2  - Smoking is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality globally. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Smoking Cessation (SC) services faced many challenges, including lockdown and social distancing restrictions. Consequently, SC services had to adapt to the challenges in different ways or halt delivery. This research evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery and outcomes of SC services. This was achieved by comparing service delivery and outcomes pre-COVID-19 and during the pandemic and drawing insights for the delivery of SC services post-pandemic. Secondary analysis was performed on the data of 11,533 participants who attended the One Life Suffolk (OLS) SC services pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 4923 and 6610 participants attended SC services pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 respectively. Fifty-four percent of participants achieved quit status at week-4 while attending the SC services during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 46% preCOVID-19, (X2(1) = 38.2, p-value<0.001). Participants who attended the SC services during the COVID-19 period were 1.7 times more likely to achieve quit status at week-4 than preCOVID-19. However, the proportion of participants lost-to-follow-up (LTF) was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period (11%) compared to pre-COVID-19 (7%), (X2(1) = 51.4, p-value <0.001). There was an increased participation and quit rate during the pandemic for modified, remotely delivered SC services indicating successful delivery of remote services during the pandemic. Although switching from face-to-face to online helped some smokers to access the service at a time of motivational readiness, despite the COVID-19 restrictions, some smokers could not access or use some aspects of the remote delivery due to a lack of internet access, poor digital literacy, no peer support and no commitment to a group during face-to-face sessions, contributing to an increased rate of LTF. Posing a major challenge to SC services delivery, COVID-19 compelled OLS SC services to adapt and be more innovative in their delivery. SC services need to continue to evolve and adapt by applying the lessons learnt during the pandemic in terms of flexibility and person-centered delivery given what did and did not work well for different demographics within the population.

N2  - Background: There is a lack of comprehensive data sources on various rating instruments that have been developed, translated, and adapted in Indian context. Aim: Accordinly, this review aimed to compile the available scales/questionnaires/instruments developed, adapted, and translated for use in India. Methods: For this, the search engines like PUBMED, Google Scholar, MedKnow, and Science Direct were searched for scales that have been developed, translated, and adapted in Indian context or an Indian language. Only articles reporting a scale/questionnaire development/interview schedules from India or in an Indian language were included. Results: Available data suggests that most of the instruments that have been translated in the Indian context have been done so in Hindi language. Very few instruments are available in other languages. The scales/instruments that are available in multiple languages include Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Edinburgh postnatal depression, Epworth sleepiness scale to evaluate daytime sleepiness, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Recovery quality of life, World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref version, Subjective happiness scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), COVID-19 stigma scale, Dyadic adjustment scale, Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ), Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Rosenzweig picture frustration study (Children’s form). Overall, very few instruments have been developed in India. Conclusion: To conclude, our review suggests that a limited number of scales have been developed in India and in terms of translation and adaptation, most of these have been done in Hindi only. Keeping these points in mind, there is a need to develop more psychometrically sound scales for research and routine clinical practice. Additionally, efforts must be made to translate and adapt scales available in different languages and subject the same to psychometric evaluations.

N2  - Maternal depression is a risk factor for future mental health problems in offspring, with stress-system function as a candidate vulnerability factor. Here we present initial validation of an online matching-task (MT) paradigm in young children exposed to maternal depression (N = 40), a first in stressor-paradigm research for this age group. Investigations of stress-system reactivity that can be conducted online are an innovative assessment approach, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate high feasibility, with a >75% data collection success rate across measures, similar-to or better-than in-person success rates in young children. Overall, the online MT elicited significant heart rate but not cortisol reactivity. Individual differences in child mental health symptoms were a moderator of reactivity to the stressor such that children with lower, but not higher, behavioral problems exhibited the typical pattern of cortisol reactivity to the online MT. Results are aligned with allostatic load models, which suggest downregulation of stress-system reactivity as a result of experiencing adversity and mental health vulnerability. Consistent with in-person research, this suggests that an early phenotype for the emergence of behavior problems may be linked to altered stress-system reactivity. Results hold potential clinical implications for intervention development and the future of online stress-system research.

N2  - PROBLEM: Limited research has examined and synthesized the adaptation of midwives and midwife-led interventions during crises. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that midwives are essential to respond to sexual and reproductive health care needs during disruptive times, and that they adapt to continue to provide their services during those circumstances. AIM: To map the adaptations of midwives when providing care during crises globally. Secondary objectives include identifying which midwives adapted, what services were adapted and how, and the demographic receiving care. STUDY METHODS: Scoping review using Levac's modifications of Arksey and O'Malley's methods. Publications and grey literature, in English and Spanish, with no limitations based on study design or date were included. Data was extracted and mapped using Wheaton and Maciver's Adaptation framework. FINDINGS: We identified 3329 records, of which forty-two were included. Midwives' prior training impacted adaptation. Midwives adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics, natural disasters, and World War II. They adapted in hospital and community settings around the provision of antenatal, labor and birth, postpartum, and contraceptive care. However, no specific data identified population demographics. Midwifery adaptations related to their practice, role, and scope of practice. CONCLUSION: The limited available evidence identified the challenges, creativity, and mutual aid activities midwives have undertaken to ensure the provision of their services. Evidence is highly concentrated around maternal health services. Further high-quality research is needed to provide a deeper understanding of how midwifery-led care can adapt to guide sustainable responses to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services during crises.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Maternity support workers (MSWs) are now a key part of the maternity workforce. They work in environments with potential exposure to traumatic events, but little is known about their rates of exposure or psychological responses. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the proportion of MSWs reporting exposure to a traumatic work event and consequential rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also aimed to identify factors associated with PTSD and to describe levels of burnout, empathy, and functional impairment, and to explore their potential associations with PTSD symptoms. METHODS: MSWs were recruited via the Royal College of Midwives newsletter, which is sent to all MSW members, and via social media on the College MSW Facebook page. Participants completed an online survey. They provided information on demographic details, job role, and exposure to traumatic events, and completed questionnaires covering PTSD symptoms related to work events, related functional impairment, burnout, and empathy. Data were analysed via correlations and multiple regression. FINDINGS: Of 98 respondents, 88 had been exposed to a traumatic work event; 79 of these through being present and nine through hearing about traumatic events. Of those exposed, 14.8% (n = 13) participants had probable PTSD, while a further 5.7 % (n = 5) met the subclinical threshold. Over a third (35.2 %) of the sample showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, a key feature of burnout, and 27.3 % reported functional work impairment. PTSD symptoms were associated with younger age, higher empathic concern, and direct exposure to traumatic perinatal events. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: MSWs are routinely exposed to traumatic events at work and are at risk of work-related PTSD. Younger and more empathic staff appear more at risk, although our methods could not distinguish cause and effect. It must also be noted that the survey took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, and findings could be influenced by this context. MSWs need to be routinely included in programmes to support staff in relation to trauma exposure at work.

N2  - AIM: To investigate predictors of low birth satisfaction in a sample of Iranian postpartum women during the COVID-19 epidemics' fifth wave. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study was conducted on 676 postpartum women admitted to postpartum wards of Mobini maternity hospital using a convenience sampling method between 2 Aug and 18 September 2021 in Iran. We used the general linear model and multiple linear regression analyses to determine predictors of birth satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation values of age and education were 28.7 ± 6.6 and 11.1 ± 4.1 (years), respectively. The mean scores of the three scales were as follows: FVC-19S (14.7 ± 7.5), WHO-5 (67.5 ± 13.0) and BSS-R (28.6 ± 7.3). Sixty-five point nine percent (65.9%) of the participants were multiparous. Overall predictors of low birth satisfaction were emergency caesarean, instrumental birth, episiotomy, Entonox analgesia, low level of well-being score < 50, fear of COVID-19, low satisfaction with pregnancy and low satisfaction with spouse's support. The overall proportion of the variance in birth satisfaction explained by all variables is 17.4%. Labor and birth variables explained 12.2% of the variance in birth satisfaction.None.

N2  - AIM: To explore the experiences and needs of postgraduate nursing students within the Nigerian context. DESIGN: This qualitative study was conducted using a descriptive phenomenological approach. METHOD: Data were collected between February and April 2022 using a purposive sampling method and telephone semi-structured interviews. Colaizzi's method of Qualitative data Analysis was utilized. Twenty-two Nigerian postgraduate nursing students were interviewed. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: challenges of Nigerian postgraduate students before the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on postgraduate education, and innovations to improve postgraduate education in Nigeria. The challenges include the burden of physical lectures, lack of infrastructure, and poor mentorship of postgraduate nursing students. The impact of the pandemic on postgraduate education includes abrupt disruption of the academic program, a prolonged academic calendar, and a communication gap between students and their research supervisors. Innovations to improve postgraduate nursing education in Nigeria also include adoption and sustainability of e-learning, upgrading post-basic to postgraduate nursing programmes, proper structuring of postgraduate nursing education, commencement of postgraduate nursing programmes in more universities and provision of financial aid for students. Our primary finding is that funding, mentorship and infrastructure were issues peculiar to all the respondents. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that efforts should be made to maintain a seamless educational program by ensuring an uninterrupted flow of learning through virtual means, thereby enhancing effective teaching and learning. IMPLICATIONS: Graduate nursing studies is one of the suggested solutions in the WHO strategic direction for nursing and midwifery globally to achieve Universal Health Coverage . The reason is that nurses can practice with more and better skills in any work setting, thus improving the quality of health care services. Our study provides insights into the experiences of postgraduate students and how these could discourage other nurses who might have thought about furthering their studies. Efforts should be made to provide all the support that these students need, using evidence from this study and similar studies to ensure they have a good learning experience and others can be motivated to learn at the graduate level as well. This will increase the proportion of nurses and midwives honed with better skills to provide more standard quality services that will improve patient care outcomes.

N2  - This study aims to investigate the relationship between Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cognition, social support, and mental health among pregnant women proposed for undergoing interventional prenatal diagnosis in Sichuan Province during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2270 pregnant women (2232 valid) who were proposed to undergo interventional prenatal diagnosis at a tertiary hospital prenatal diagnosis center in Sichuan Province from January to December 2022 were selected by Convenience sampling and surveyed using a self-administered general information questionnaire, social support rating scale, mental health questionnaire (including: Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale), and self-administered COVID-19 cognition questionnaire. Structural equation modeling showed that social support negatively predicted anxiety (β = −0.34, t = −14.98, P < .001) and negatively predicted depressive status (β = −0.21, t = −9.57, P < .001); COVID-19 cognition negatively predicted anxiety (β = −0.76, t = −5.34, P < .001) and depression (β = −0.40, t = −2.99, P < .01); anxiety positively predicted anxiety (β = 0.73, t = 37.34, P < .001). The overall knowledge rate of COVID-19 cognition among 2232 pregnant women who were to undergo interventional prenatal diagnosis was 76.40%. The fit indices of the model were: CMIN/DF = 3.071, GFI = 0.999, AGFI = 0.993, CFI = 0.999, RMSEA = 0.030, NFI = 0.998, and TLI = 0.992, indicating that the model had a good fit and the model was scientifically valid. Pregnant women in Sichuan province who are to undergo prenatal interventional diagnosis have a medium level of COVID-19 awareness, and their level of COVID-19 awareness and social support will directly affect their anxiety and depression level, and their anxiety level will also affect their depression level. We should give more attention to pregnant women, especially those in particular situations such as advanced age, poor maternal history, family history of genetic disease, etc, they should be given adequate care and social support, and multiple channels and types of health education should be provided for the COVID-19 to improve the pregnant women’s knowledge of COVID-19, which is important for improving the mental health of pregnant women.

N2  - A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken (July-August 2020) to ascertain parents' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of being at home with their newborn baby in the first 6 weeks. Participants (n = 371) were mostly biological mothers (n = 369, 99.4%), white British (n = 351, 94,5%), first baby (n = 186, 50%). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between maternal confidence and number of children (rho (369) = 0.295, p < .001) and baby's age at time of participation (rho (369) = 0.139, p = .009). Participants without higher educational qualifications (median = 62, SIQR = 3.5) had statistically significant higher confidence (U = 11831.500, p < .001) than participants with higher educational qualifications (median = 58, SIQR = 2). Parents of babies without health issues at birth (median, 61, SIQR = 3.5) had statistically significant higher confidence (U = 13213.500, p < .001) than parents of babies with health issues at birth (median = 58, SIQR = 5). Three qualitative themes have emerged: the impact of "no partner" restrictions; mixed emotions and lack of information and support. In conclusion, parenting during a pandemic created anxiety and fear, affected by "no partner" restrictions, not being allowed to appointments, scans, and during labor. Some parents were more confident and indicated benefits including heightening bonding with baby and partner during social distancing.

N2  - Amid new abortion restrictions in the USA, scientific advances in genetic technologies and investigations of COVID-19 vaccinations in pregnancy, news stories about reproduction abound, often accompanied by images of what journalist Josie Glausiusz has called the "headless, legless, pregnancy bump". These images of disembodied pregnant torsos at once improve search engine optimisation for news organisations while perpetuating the view of the 'bump' as the quintessential visual representation of pregnancy.The images that accompany news articles convey meaning beyond what is included in the text and work to reinforce stereotypes about race, gender and age. In the so-called obesity epidemic, for example, psychotherapist and fat activist Charlotte Cooper documented how images of fat people with their heads cropped out view had become a visual symbol of abjection-'the headless fatty'-without a face or agency to speak of. The use of 'headless preggos' similarly divorces pregnant people from the embodied experience of their pregnancies, reducing them to a single body part.In this article, we chronicle our experiences tracking images of headless preggos via Twitter, arguing that their use works to erase pregnant people's autonomy and to construct the fetus as the central concern in reproductive interventions. We begin by tracing the evolution of visual representations of pregnancy including the increasing focus on the fetus and 'bump'. We then provide a description of our experience with the Twitter account, including our exchanges with academics, journalists and others that highlight how the continued reliance on headless preggos obscures the experiences of pregnant people by focusing all attention on the fetus, as well as how the same images might be thoughtfully deployed. We conclude by offering suggestions for those creating and selecting images that might result in more robust, creative visual representations of pregnancy and reproduction.

N2  - Purpose: To estimate the societal costs of untreated perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) in Vermont for the 2018–2020 average annual birth cohort from conception through five years postpartum. Methods: We developed a cost analysis model to calculate the excess cases of outcomes attributed to PMADs in the state of Vermont. Then, we modeled the associated costs of each outcome incurred by birthing parents and their children, projected five years for birthing parents who do not achieve remission by the end of the first year postpartum. Results: We estimated that the total societal cost of untreated PMADs in Vermont could reach $48 million for an annual birth cohort from conception to five years postpartum, amounting to $35,910 in excess societal costs per birthing parent with an untreated PMAD and their child. Conclusion: Our model provides evidence of the high costs of untreated PMADs for birthing parents and their children in Vermont. Our estimates for Vermont are slightly higher but comparable to national estimates, which are $35,500 per birthing parent–child pair, adjusted to 2021 US dollars. Investing in perinatal mental health prevention and treatment could improve health outcomes and reduce economic burden of PMADs on individuals, families, employers, and the state.

N2  - Objective: The study investigated the mediation mechanisms between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection risk perception and depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Study data were derived from a sample of 463 pregnant women in Hubei Province, the province with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak in China. Data were collected in two phases (during and after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the COVID-19 infection risk perception scales, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Peritrauma Distress Inventory (PDI). Mediation model analysis was used for data analysis, overall and by groups. Results: The level of depressive symptoms among pregnant women after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was moderate (median, 9.00 [25th percentile, 75th percentile = 5.00, 12.00]), higher than the acute group (median, 7.00 [25th percentile, 75th percentile = 4.50, 10.00]). Perceived stress and traumatic stress fully mediated the relationship between infection worry (total indirect effect, 0.39 [95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.54])/infection possibility (total indirect effect, 0.41 [95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.61]) and depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the relationship was only fully mediated by perceived stress after the acute pandemic. Conclusions: Effects of risk perception on depressive symptoms varied by periods of COVID-19. These findings have important implications for developing effective prevention and early psychoeducational intervention strategies for pregnant women with a high risk of depressive symptoms during different periods of emerging infectious diseases.

N2  - Introduction: Efficient epidemiological monitoring of virus diseases is crucial in evaluating general public health, the prevalence of specific diseases, the pattern of spread, and implementing preventative and control strategies into action. Methods: This study analyzed data obtained from the Field Epidemiology Program (FETP) which is part of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia, which contained reported cases of infectious diseases over four years, from January 2018 to December 2021, to investigate and highlight the significant trend and incidence rate for each viral infectious disease. Results: Of the reported viral infectious diseases, hepatitis B and C, dengue fever (DF), influenza, chickenpox, and measles were the highest reported viral cases over four years. For the aforementioned diseases, males were often more susceptible to viral infections than females. Except for DF, this viral infection was more common in Saudi citizens. Viral illnesses like hand, foot, and mouth disease were less prevalent, while neurological viral disorders such as acute flaccid paralysis were rarely detected. There was an overall reduction in viral cases recorded during 2020–2021, which may be attributed to the implementation of preventive measures during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic or an underreporting of cases during the lockdown of that time. Conclusion: The prevalence of these common viral infections in the Saudi population suggests that understanding the mechanisms influencing changes in these viruses, methods of transmission, and the burden of these diseases is a priority for health policy. This understanding is necessary to develop effective intervention and preventive strategies.

N2  - Objectives: Women remain underrepresented in the emergency medicine (EM) workforce, academic EM, and institutional leadership. In order to support women physicians in EM, we must explore factors that contribute to attrition and workplace satisfaction. For example, tensions between workplace and familial roles are important to consider as women navigate careers in EM. The logistics and stressors of workplace lactation pose a particular challenge during an already stressful time for a new mother returning to work in a busy emergency department (ED), but limited empirical data exist regarding this experience. We aimed to explore the stressors associated with workplace lactation spaces in order to better inform the creation of lactation spaces for individuals working in EDs. Methods: Our team used an exploratory qualitative design to investigate lactation-specific stressors and understand their relationship to individuals’ needs when lactating in EM workplace environments. A total of 40 individuals were interviewed, highlighting post-pregnancy return-to-work (RTW) experiences of medical students, residents, advanced practice professionals, nurses, fellows, and faculty. Interviews were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: We identified both tangible and intangible characteristics of lactation spaces that contribute to stress for lactating individuals. Additionally, we discovered that participants frequently noted a desire to work simultaneously while pumping in order to feel they were self-actualizing in their dual roles of parent and clinician. Among tangible items, access to a computer within lactation space was a key driver of ability to fulfill dual roles. Among intangible characteristics, we identified three distinct, yet interrelated, subthemes, including the need for lactation spaces to be respectful of individuals’ time, privacy, and general health and well-being. Conclusions: This study suggests that meeting basic lactation needs with thoughtfully designed lactation spaces can empower individuals in their roles both as a lactating parent and a clinician. EM leadership can evaluate existing lactation spaces to ensure they meet the tangible and intangible needs of lactating physicians, trainees, advanced practice professionals, and nurses.

N2  - Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in 2019 has necessitated investigating its potential adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes and fetal development. Objective: This study aimed to review the evidence on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on fetal outcomes. Method of Study: Literatures since the outbreak of COVID-19 from PubMed and Web of Science were summarized in this narrative review, to show the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on fetal development. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy can be transmitted vertically through the placenta, both in utero and perinatally, affecting the maternal–fetal immune interface and placental function. Viral infections during pregnancy have been linked to central nervous system development impairments and disorders such as autism. Changes in the structure and function of the respiratory, immune, and visceral systems have also been reported. SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been linked with increased risks of stillbirth and preterm birth. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear and may include cytokine storms, macrophage mediation, genetic mutations, methylation, and other epigenetic changes. Exploring the protective effects of antiviral treatment and other interventions in animal and clinical studies may help improve outcomes. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy activates the maternal–fetal immune interface through vertical transmission, and has short- and long-term effects on fetal development, including the central nervous system. Future long-term studies may help provide evidence that can inform interventions to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.

N2  - Understanding COVID-19’s effects on susceptible populations remains essential for clinical implementations. Our review aimed to examine whether the pandemic significantly impacted the stress levels in the mothers of premature infants in NICUs. The review of the literature from Google Scholar and PubMed resulted in identifying specific stressors such as the disruption of healthcare systems, limited access to neonatal care, uncertainty due to frequent changes in restrictions, the risk of COVID-19 infection, social isolation, and financial stress. While some quantitative studies concerning this topic did not show a significant increase in the perception of stress in this population compared to the pre-pandemic group, various research has indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic may result in enduring impacts on the emotional and neurological development of children. This article demonstrates a correlation between the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and an elevated incidence of depressive symptoms among the mothers of premature infants. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of pandemic-induced stress.

N2  - The main objective of this study was to examine the actor and partner effects between Perceived Workplace Support for Families (PWSFs) and family support (PFS), diet quality, and satisfaction with food-related life (SWFoL) in households with both parents working and adolescents, along with the role of the three family members’ diet quality as a mediator. During the second year of the pandemic in Chile, 860 dual-earner parents of different sexes and their adolescent child (average age 13 years, with 50.7% being male) were recruited from two cities. Parents responded to a measure of PWSFs and the Perceived Family Support Scale. Mothers, fathers, and adolescents answered the Adapted Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the satisfaction with food-related life Scale. The examination employed the mediation Actor–Partner Interdependence Model and structural equation modeling for the analyses. Results showed that mothers’ PWSFs improved their and their teenage children’s SWFoL, while fathers’ PWSFs only improved their SWFoL. The mothers’ PFS improved their and the fathers’ diet quality while enhancing their SWFoL and the adolescents’ SWFoL. The fathers’ PFS enhanced their and the adolescents’ SWFoL. The mothers’ PFS also indirectly enhanced their and the fathers’ SWFoL via each parent’s diet quality. Each family member’s diet quality was positively related to their SWFoL, while mothers’ diet quality was positively related to the fathers’ SWFoL. These results imply that resources obtained by parents from PFS positively impact the SWFoL of the three family members through different mechanisms. They also highlight the importance of maternal family support for SWFoL during the pandemic.

N2  - Introduction: Cervical cancer still ranks highest causing cancer-related morbidity and mortality in women in India. It is prudent to emphasise and implement cervical cancer screening strategies in the population efficiently and with regular intervals. Conventionally, PAP smear cytology is obtained by wooden spatula-Ayre’s spatula. To improve sensitivity and specificity of the procedure and detection rate, better techniques of cells retrieval are available mainly liquid-based cytology (LBC), with help of cyto-brush. Literature has consistently proven efficiency of the technique and also reduced the proportion of inadequate sampling. We conduct this study to compare both the techniques and efficiency in a community hospital from data over 6 years, to asses its role and benefits among Indian women. Aims and Objectives: To compare conventional PAP smear and liquid-based cytology techniques analysing detection rates of positive lesions (CIN and also includes ASCUS and malignant), incidence of inadequate sampling, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Methods: This is retrospective study at tertiary care obstetric hospital affiliated to government-run medical college in a metropolitan city of Mumbai. Data are retrieved from the Pathology Department, Medical Records Department, laboratory books and OPD registers. Pap’s smear sampling was done mainly from OPD with all indications including routine tests as a part of gynaecological evaluation and screening, as well as for suspicious lesions on inspection. Group A consists women who had conventional PAP smear test for 3 years (Dec 2015–Nov 2018) and Group B had women who benefited by LBC method for 3 years (Dec 2018–Nov 2021). COVID-19 pandemic majorly affected the routine gynaecological OPD practice during 2021 as hospital was COVID facility hospital. Results: Demographic parameters and presentations were comparable and similar. LBC methods have higher detection rate for positive reports, including ASCUS. But results were comparable in both groups and not statistically different. Importantly, incidences of inadequate sampling are reduced significantly with the LBC method. Unsatisfactory smears war high in Group A (7.752%) compared to Group B (3.712%) p-value 0.005, stating the increased rate of requirement of sending repeat smears, which involves higher engagement of time, resources and active participation from healthcare personnel. Conclusion: Good detection rates and significantly low rates of unsatisfactory smears make LBC rational and cost-effective. These are the times to switch to liquid-based cytology techniques, especially at the community level hospitals; in order to detect more women with cervical premalignant as well as malignant neoplastic lesions and to save lives. This can be made possible by emphasising the policy makers to incorporate these services through quality resources.

N2  - Introduction: Our safety-net hospital implemented a hospital-based tobacco treatment intervention in 2016. We previously showed the intervention, an “opt-out” Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based Best Practice Alert (BPA)+ order-set that triggers consultation to an inpatient Tobacco Treatment Consult (TTC) service for all patients who smoke, improves smoking abstinence. We now report on sustainability, 6 years after inception. Aims and Methods: We analyzed data collected between July 2016–June 2022 of patients documented as “currently smoking” in the EHR. Across the 6 years, we used Pearson’s correlation analysis to compare Adoption (clinician acceptance of the BPA+ order-set, thus generating consultation to the TTC service); Reach (number of consultations completed by the TTC service); and Effectiveness (receipt of pharmacotherapy orders between patients receiving and not receiving consultations). Results: Among 39 558 adult admissions (July 2016–June 2022) with “currently smoking” status in the EHR for whom the BPA triggered, clinicians accepted the TTC order set on 50.4% (19 932/39 558), though acceptance varied across services (eg, Cardiology [71%] and Obstetrics-Gynecology 12%]). The TTC service consulted on 17% (6779/39 558) of patients due to staffing constraints. Consultations ordered (r = −0.28, p = .59) and completed (r = 0.45, p = .37) remained stable over 6-years. Compared to patients not receiving consultations, patients receiving consultations were more likely to receive pharmacotherapy orders overall (inpatient: 50.8% vs. 35.1%, p < .0001; at discharge: 27.1% vs. 10%, p < .0001) and in each year. Conclusions: The “opt-out” EHR-based TTC service is sustainable, though many did not receive consultations due to resource constraints. Health care systems should elevate the priority of hospital-based tobacco treatment programs to increase reach to underserved populations. Implications: Our study shows that opt-out approaches that utilize the EHR are a sustainable approach to providing evidence-based tobacco treatment to all hospitalized individuals who smoke, regardless of readiness to stop smoking and clinical condition.

N2  - Study Objectives: Insomnia symptoms are common during the perinatal period and are linked to adverse outcomes.This single-blind three-arm randomized-controlled trial examined whether two interventions targeting different mechanisms prevent postpartum insomnia. Methods: Participants were nulliparous females 26–32 weeks gestation with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores ≥ 8, recruited in Australia and randomized 1:1:1 to: (1) a responsive bassinet (RB) designed to support infant sleep and reduce maternal sleep disruption until 6 months postpartum, (2) therapist-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered during pregnancy and postpartum, or (3) a sleep hygiene booklet (control; CTRL). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), 35–36 weeks gestation (T2), and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum (T3–T5). The primary outcome was ISI scores averaged T3–T5. Primary analyses were regressions controlling for baseline outcomes. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven participants (age M ± SD = 32.62 ± 3.49) were randomized (RB = 44, CBT-I = 42, CTRL = 41). Both interventions were feasible and well-accepted, with few related adverse events reported. Compared to CTRL, the average ISI across T3–T5 was lower for CBT-I (p = .014, effect size [ES] = 0.56, medium) but not RB (p = .270, ES = 0.25, small). Exploratory findings on maternal insomnia diagnosis, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, beliefs and attitudes about sleep, depression, anxiety, as well as infant sleep outcomes were also presented. Conclusions: CBT-I but not RB reduced prenatal insomnia (very large effect) and prevented postpartum insomnia (medium effect). Further research is needed to examine the effects of both CBT-I and RB on other outcomes such as sleep-related well-being, postpartum depression, and maternal postpartum sleep duration.

N2  - Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has resulted in a crippled healthcare system worldwide. In this unprecedented situation, it is important to analyse the impact on the vulnerable population of pregnant women, especially those with high-risk pregnancies and those undergoing a Caesarean section (CS). Aim: To analyse the clinical profile, foetomaternal outcomes, and co-morbidities in COVID-19-affected pregnancy cases undergoing a CS. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Government Medical College, and New Civil Hospital in Surat, Gujarat, India during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from April 2020 to December 2020. The study included a total of 65 cases of COVID-19-positive mothers undergoing a C-section. Demographic parameters such as age, obstetric history, details of the C-section (like gestational age at the time of the procedure, indication, and category of the C-section), associated co-morbidities, severity of COVID-19-related symptoms and treatment, neonatal parameters {such as birth weight, Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration (APGAR) score, and COVID-19 status of the baby at birth} were analysed. Additionally, a comparison of the C-section rate and complications such as the development of severe anaemia requiring blood transfusion, postoperative development of urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, and the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was conducted between COVID-19-affected and unaffected pregnancies undergoing a C-section during the study period. Data on COVID-19 negative cases were obtained from the monthly labour room statistics submitted to the department. The Chi-square test and Fisher’s-exact test were used to compare parameters of the COVID-19 positive and negative groups and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of a total of 6246 deliveries conducted at the institute during the study period, the CS rate among affected and non affected women was 44.5% (65 out of 146) vs. 32.8% (2006 out of 6100) {p=0.003, Relative Risk (RR) 1.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.12-1.62}. The mean age of women with COVID-19 undergoing a CS was 25.3 years. The difference in the rate of blood transfusion requirement in COVID-19-affected cases was 9 out of 65 (13.8%) vs. 120 out of 2006 (6%) in COVID-19 negative pregnancies (RR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.3). The difference in the rate of urinary tract infections in the postoperative period was statistically significant in COVID-19-infected patients, 5 out of 65 (7.7%) vs. 58 out of 2006 (2.9%) in non infected patients (p=0.0451, RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.4). The prevalence of hypertensive disorders among COVID-19 positive and negative mothers undergoing CS was very high in the present study (16 out of 65, 24.6% vs. 160 out of 2006, 8.1%, RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.9-4.8). Neonatal parameters like low APGAR score at birth were seen in 5 cases (8%), low birth weight in 20 cases (30%), and 3 babies (4.5%) were COVID-19 positive at birth. Conclusion: Higher rates of caesarean sections, increased prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, anaemia requiring blood transfusion, and postoperative development of urinary tract infections among COVID-19-affected mothers undergoing a caesarean section.

N2  - Data on the HIV care cascade demonstrated challenges in achieving Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) targets across all 18 EHE focus metropolitan areas, but innovative adherence interventions using point-of-care tenofovir testing and motivational interviewing support care cascade outcomes in Namibia and South Africa, respectively. Data on treatment with long-acting injectable (LAI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) demonstrated high acceptability, retention, and virologic suppression including in groups that were not well represented in clinical trials including persons born female and persons with detectable viral loads. The adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine appeared to be safe and appeared to be superior to conventional hepatitis B vaccines in persons with HIV (PWH) who were prior nonresponders to the hepatitis B vaccine. New therapies are in the pipeline for LAI hepatitis C medication that may cure hepatitis C with 1 injection. ACTG (AIDS Clinical Trials Group) A5359 showed that long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) can be used effectively in PWH experiencing adherence challenges to oral ART and suggested a paradigm for treating this population with an unmet medical need. Studies on resistance mutations in SARS-COV-2 show that treatment-related emergent resistance does not appear to contribute to viral rebound or have the potential for transmitted drug resistance. The data presented on HIV and maternal and pediatric health included findings from studies on the implementation of first-line dolutegravir-based ART in pregnant and postpartum women and children, along with results of a phase I/II trial involving LA CAB/RPV in adolescents. Additionally, various abstracts addressed hypertensive disorders in HIV during pregnancy and postpartum periods, as well as the intersection of HIV and mental health in women and youth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant and postpartum women infected by COVID-19 are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including negative effects on their mental health. Brazilian maternal mortality rate due to COVID-19 is 2.5 times higher than overall mortality rates. This study aimed to understand how pregnant/postpartum women experienced the COVID-19 suspicion/investigation or confirmed infection in different Brazilian cities, the pandemic's consequences to women and their families, and their needs to improve maternal health services during public health emergencies. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 27 women with COVID-19 and 6 of their family members, as part of a multicenter study among 15 maternity hospitals in Brazil. We applied in-depth interviews through telephone calls when women received the diagnostic or had a suspect infection and after 60 days. Another semi-structured interview was applied to their close family members. The interviews were considered through thematic analysis. RESULTS: From the thematic content analysis three major themes emerged from the first and second interviews: (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) assistance received by the woman and newborn in the medical services; (World Health Organization (WHO) 2021) stigma/fear of contamination from health workers and from family and friends reported by the women; (Allotey et al., 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic impact. CONCLUSION: Before the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, pregnant women experienced fear of death, hospitalization, quarantine, loss of family members, and financial repercussions, resulting in physical, psychological, and socioeconomic impacts on these women's lives.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Birthmark Doula Collective, a cooperative that provides doula and lactation services in the Greater New Orleans area, mounted an emergency response after two Category 4 storms: Hurricane Laura (2020) and Hurricane Ida (2021). The response included activating a no-cost emergency perinatal and infant feeding hotline. Both disasters coincided with a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in Louisiana. RESEARCH AIM: The aim of this study is to understand how an emergency perinatal and infant feeding hotline supported infant and young child feeding in emergencies during hurricanes in Louisiana. METHOD: This study used a cross-sectional, retrospective qualitative design in a population with low breastfeeding rates. We conducted a content analysis of 97 hotline call logs from Hurricanes Laura and Ida, focus groups with lactation support providers who staffed the hotline during either storm (n = 5), and interviews with mothers who called during Hurricane Ida (n = 2). Focus groups and interviews lasted 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Call logs revealed infant feeding needs (e.g., mastitis, low milk supply, relactation, and infant formula requests) and non-infant feeding needs (e.g., infant supplies, perinatal and infant care referrals, shelter information). Infant formula was the most requested supply during both hurricanes. Maternal participants discussed family vulnerabilities during Hurricane Ida. Staff described training and strategies to provide support while maintaining their own well-being. CONCLUSION: Providing a free emergency hotline service is one way to support pregnant and postpartum people and their families seeking infant feeding advice, supplies, and support in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.

N2  - Breastfeeding is the optimal form of nutrition for infants and young children. The World Health Organization recommends that babies are breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months of life, and up to the age of 2 years or beyond in combination with complementary food. Breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates are suboptimal globally and very low in the Republic of Ireland where health promotion initiatives and healthcare professional support predominantly focus on the important phase of initiation and early months of the breastfeeding journey. This qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore the experiences of women who chose to breastfeed their children beyond 1 year of age in the Republic of Ireland. Fourteen women participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted. The analysis generated three overarching themes: (1) Influences on breastfeeding beyond 1 year, (2) Sustaining breastfeeding and (3) Benefits of breastfeeding beyond 1 year. Family, friends, peers, culture and commercial milk formula marketing had an influence on breastfeeding journeys. Support, determination, knowledge, bed-sharing and Covid-19 pandemic social restrictions helped to sustain breastfeeding beyond 1 year. Benefits of breastfeeding beyond 1 year such as nutrition, strengthening of emotional bonds, development of a parenting tool, and protection of child and maternal health were identified. Our findings support the need for discussions and further research on the normalization of breastfeeding beyond 1 year in the Republic of Ireland, targeted health promotion initiatives and education programmes for healthcare professionals on supporting the continuation of breastfeeding.

N2  - Objective This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the national prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in Uganda and identify predictors in both pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 eras. Design Used a systematic review and meta-analysis methodology. Data sources Reviewed papers were sourced from Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL/EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and African Journals Online. Eligibility criteria for selected studies The review encompassed observational studies published on PPD in Uganda from 1 January 2000 to 30 November 2023. Results 11 studies (involving 7564 participants) published from 1 January 2000 to 30 November 2023 were reviewed. The pooled prevalence of PPD in Uganda was 29% (95% CI 21% to 37%, I2=98.32%). Subgroup analysis indicated a similar prevalence before (29%, 95% CI 20% to 39%) and during (28%, 95% CI 22% to 32%) the COVID-19 period. Special groups exhibited a higher prevalence (32%, 95% CI 16% to 47%) than general postpartum women (28%, 95% CI 19% to 37%). Factors associated with PPD included poor social support (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.22, I2=96.8%), maternal illness (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.26, I2=96.9%), poor socioeconomic status (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.46, I2=99.5%) and undergoing caesarean section (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.17, I2=80.6%). Surprisingly, there was a marginal decrease in PPD during the COVID-19 period. Subgroup analysis highlighted a higher prevalence among mothers with HIV. Conclusion This study underscores the significant prevalence of PPD in Uganda, with sociodemographic factors increasing risk. Despite a slight decrease during the COVID-19 period, the importance of prioritising maternal mental health is emphasised, considering sociodemographic factors and pandemic challenges, to improve maternal and child health outcomes and overall well-being.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the unprecedented popularity of digital financial services for contactless payments and government cash transfer programs to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on the use of digital financial services for health in low- and middle-income countries, however, is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the use of a mobile maternal health wallet, with a particular focus on delineating the age-dependent differential effects, and draw conclusions on the effect of lockdown measures on the use of digital health services. METHODS: We analyzed 819,840 person-days of health wallet use data from 3416 women who used health care at 25 public sector primary care facilities and 4 hospitals in Antananarivo, Madagascar, between January 1 and August 27, 2020. We collected data on savings, payments, and voucher use at the point of care. To estimate the effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Madagascar, we used regression discontinuity analysis around the starting day of the first COVID-19 lockdown on March 23, 2020. We determined the bandwidth using a data-driven method for unbiased bandwidth selection and used modified Poisson regression for binary variables to estimate risk ratios as lockdown effect sizes. RESULTS: We recorded 3719 saving events, 1572 payment events, and 3144 use events of electronic vouchers. The first COVID-19 lockdown in Madagascar reduced mobile money savings by 58.5% (P<.001), payments by 45.8% (P<.001), and voucher use by 49.6% (P<.001). Voucher use recovered to the extrapolated prelockdown counterfactual after 214 days, while savings and payments did not cross the extrapolated prelockdown counterfactual. The recovery duration after the lockdown differed by age group. Women aged >30 years recovered substantially faster, returning to prelockdown rates after 34, 226, and 77 days for savings, payments, and voucher use, respectively. Younger women aged <25 years did not return to baseline values. The results remained robust in sensitivity analyses using ±20 days of the optimal bandwidth. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown greatly reduced the use of mobile money in the health sector, affecting savings, payments, and voucher use. Savings were the most significantly reduced, implying that the lockdown affected women's expectations of future health care use. Declines in payments and voucher use indicated decreased actual health care use caused by the lockdown. These effects are crucial since many maternal and child health care services cannot be delayed, as the potential benefits will be lost or diminished. To mitigate the adverse impacts of lockdowns on maternal health service use, digital health services could be leveraged to provide access to telemedicine and enhance user communication with clear information on available health care access options and adherence to safety protocols.

N2  - Objectives We compared the cost-effectiveness of hospital-based treatment and that of community treatment centres (CTCs). Design We performed statistical analysis to compare the expenses incurred by COVID-19 patients who received hospital care with those incurred by COVID-19 patients who went to CTCs. Setting and participants A study was conducted on 411 530 COVID-19 inpatients and 243 329 CTC patients from January 2020 to December 2021. Main outcome measures We calculated the probability of severe disease, hospitalisation period and medical expenses for inpatients and CTC patients. Subsequently, we analysed the cost-effectiveness of CTC compared with hospitalisation. Results Comparing medical expenses, CTC patients incurred 2 220 000 KRW on average, which is less than the expenses incurred by hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Conclusions The study suggests that using a CTC may be more cost-effective than a hospital service alone.

N2  - Introduction Breastfeeding is associated with many health benefits for both women and their newborns. Exclusive breastfeeding has been recommended for at least 6 months to optimise infant growth, development and health. In addition to standard care, community-based peer support is recommended to help mothers improve breastfeeding. A recent survey reveals that the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months post partum in Hong Kong is low, and half of all breastfeeding mothers never exclusively breastfeed. Taking into account the local practice for women to stay home during the first month post partum and social isolation during and post-COVID-19 pandemic, a home-based peer support programme with the aid of Zoom or Facetime is proposed. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based breastfeeding peer support programme in improving breastfeeding practices and achieving exclusive breastfeeding rate among women with low breastfeeding self-efficacy. Methods and analysis The study is a two-Armed randomised control trial and will include a total of 442 participants. Potential cases will be recruited and screened at four postnatal wards in Hong Kong public hospital. Eligible and consented cases will be randomly allocated into intervention or control groups at a 1:1 ratio. Control group (n=221) will receive standard care, while the intervention group (n=221) will receive home-based peer support as well as standard care. Trained peer counsellors will provide breastfeeding-related support through Zoom or Facetime at 10 days and 1 month post partum. Telephone follow-ups will be conducted at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months post partum. Breastfeeding status, mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy and postpartum depression will be assessed and compared between the two arms. Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 20-564). The findings will be updated in trial registries and disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences. Trial registration number NCT04621266.

N2  - Introduction The Middle East and North African (MENA) region is characterised by high and complex migration flows, yet little is known about the health of migrant populations, their levels of underimmunisation and access to healthcare provision. Data are needed to support regional elimination and control targets for key diseases and the design and delivery of programmes to improve health outcomes in these groups. This protocol describes a suite of seven systematic reviews that aim to identify, appraise and synthesise the available evidence on the burden and health outcomes, policies and access (barriers and facilitators) related to these mobile populations in the region. Methods Seven systematic reviews will cover three questions to explore the: (1) burden and health outcomes, (2) policies and (3) healthcare barriers and facilitators for the following seven disease areas in migrants in the MENA region: tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis B and C, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, diabetes, mental health, maternal and neonatal health, and vaccine-preventable diseases. We will search electronic databases for studies in any language (year 2000-2023), reference-check relevant publications and cross-check included studies with experts. We will search for grey literature by hand searching key databases and websites (including regional organisations and MoH websites) for country-specific guidelines and talking to our network of experts for local and regional reports and key datasets. We will assess the studies and policies for their quality using appropriate tools. We will meta-analyse the data by disease outcome if they are of sufficient volume and similarity. Where meta-analysis is not possible and where data are on policy or access, we will narratively synthesise the evidence using summary tables, figures and text. Dissemination We anticipate disseminating the findings through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and other formats relevant to all stakeholders. We are following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and protocols will be registered on International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

N2  - The COVID-19 lockdown has forced young children to spend more time on media and significantly impacted their mothers' mental health. This study explored how mothers' individual distress influences children's problematic media use during the Shanghai citywide lockdown caused by COVID-19. Data were collected from 1889 Chinese mothers (Mage = 34.69 years, SD = 3.94 years) with preschoolers aged 3-6 years (Mage = 4.38 years, SD = 1.06 years; 49.0% boys) via an online survey. The statistical analyses relied on SPSS Statistics version 26.0 and macro-program PROCESS 3.3. to investigate the associations and mediation analysis among all the study variables. The results indicated a positive association between maternal distress and children's problematic media use, mediated by parenting stress and maladaptive parenting. Specifically, the serial mediation analysis revealed that high levels of maternal distress exacerbate parenting stress, which in turn leads to maladaptive parenting practices. These maladaptive practices subsequently increase problematic media use in preschool children. The findings highlighted that parents need to enhance their ability to manage risk and promote mental health during periods of significant stress and routine disruption to reduce children's problematic media use.

N2  - It has now been extensively documented that parental mental health has deteriorated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although pandemic-related stress has been widespread, parents faced the unique challenge of navigating remote schooling. Parental oversight of children's education, loss of access to school supportive resources, and the challenges of remote learning may have been most problematic for parents of children with or at elevated risk for mental health difficulties. In the current study, we examined interactive effects of parent-reported pandemic-related caregiving stress and child internalizing and externalizing problems on parental depressive symptoms in a community-based cohort (N = 115) in the Northeast of the United States. Results indicated that parents experiencing higher levels of pandemic-related caregiving stress whose children exhibited elevated externalizing behaviors reported heightened levels of depressive symptoms. Greater child internalizing problems were associated with higher parental depressive symptoms independent of caregiving stress. These findings point to conditions that might heighten risk for parent mental health challenges in the context of ongoing remote or hybrid learning and pandemic-associated restrictions. Further, the findings point to conditions and characteristics that may be screened to identify and intervene with vulnerable families to mitigate mental health problems.

N2  - The present study explored the coping strategies used by pregnant women and new mothers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The sample of the study comprised 524 women (209 pregnant women and 315 new mothers) residing in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh States of India. The data of the study was collected by using a self-structured Coping Strategy Questionnaire for Pregnant Women and New Mothers via Google Forms. No significant difference was recorded in the coping mechanisms used by the participants across different stages of pregnancy and COVID zones. However, pregnant women were found to use significantly more ‘understanding problem strategy’ as compared to new mothers. Similarly, the mothers who have babies under six months of age were found to use more ‘understanding problem’ and ‘using instrumental social support’ strategies compared to mothers whose babies were older than six months.

To the best of our knowledge, this patient was the youngest infant successfully discharged after the VA-ECMO for COVID-19. We report one complication of ECMO support, which was bleeding from the site of the radial artery cannulation. We followed up this patient for 6 months after the discharge: delayed psychomotor development and inability to swallow were noted. Follow-up CT 3 months after the discharge showed linear fibrosis of S5 lung segment.

N2  - Objectives: The 12-month vaccination campaign ¡Ándale! ¿Qué Esperas? was launched to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates in Latinx populations in California by expanding community outreach. The objectives of this evaluation were to (1) determine predictors of vaccination rates and (2) identify barriers to vaccination and potential solutions. Methods: Five community partners in California serving Latinx populations with high social vulnerability participated in the ¡Ándale! ¿Qué Esperas? campaign. Community health workers were hired to deliver outreach (virtual, one-on-one, group based, and information dissemination), vaccinations, and supportive services. We collected data on outreach strategy used (method and location), number of vaccinations provided and reasons for delay, and number of times that supportive services were provided. We used regression models to assess significant predictors of vaccinations and supportive services. Results: Community health workers (N = 146) hired from June 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, performed outreach engagements (n = 6297) and supportive services (n = 313 796), resulting in 130 413 vaccinations and 28 660 vaccine appointments. The number of vaccinations administered was significantly higher at events in which supportive services were provided versus not provided (coefficient = 34.02; 95% CI, 3.34-64.68; P =.03). The odds ratio of supportive services was 3.67 (95% CI, 1.76-7.55) during virtual outreach and 2.95 (95% CI, 2.37-3.69) during one-on-one outreach (P <.001 for both) as compared with information dissemination encounters. Vaccination concerns were reported among 55.0% of vaccinated survey respondents (67.7%, vaccine confidence; 51.7%, access). Conclusions: Supportive services facilitate vaccinations, ease transportation and time barriers, and instill confidence among working-class racial and ethnic minority populations.

N2  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created disruption in health care delivery, including a sudden transition to telehealth use in mid-March 2020. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the mode of prenatal care visits and predictors of telehealth use (provider-patient messaging, telephone visits, and video visits) during the COVID-19 pandemic among those receiving care in a large, academic nurse-midwifery service. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of those enrolled for prenatal care in 2 nurse-midwifery clinics between 2019 and 2021 (n = 3172). Use outcomes included number and type of encounter: in-person and telehealth (primary outcome). Comparisons were made in frequency and types of encounters before and during COVID-19. A negative binomial regression was fit on the outcome of telehealth encounter count, with race/ethnicity, age, language, parity, hypertension, diabetes, and depression as predictors. Results: When comparing pre–COVID-19 (before March 2020) with during COVID-19 (after March 2020), overall encounters increased from 15.9 to 19.5 mean number of encounters per person (P <.001). The increase was driven by telehealth encounters; there were no significant differences for in-person prenatal visit counts before and during the pandemic period. Direct patient-provider messaging was the most common type of telehealth encounter. Predictors of telehealth encounters included English as primary language and diagnoses of diabetes or depression. Discussion: No differences in the frequency of in-person prenatal care visits suggests that telehealth encounters led to more contact with midwives and did not replace in-person encounters. Spanish-speaking patients were least likely to use telehealth-delivered prenatal care during the pandemic; a small, but significant, proportion of patients had no or few telehealth encounters, and a significant proportion had high use of telehealth. Integration of telehealth in future delivery of prenatal care should consider questions of equity, patient and provider satisfaction, access, redundancies, and provider workload.

N2  - Objectives: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) are a common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding associated with various systemic diseases including COVID-19. Although an increasing number of such cases is reported in the literature, there is a lack of systematic evidence summarizing the etiology and neuroimaging findings of these lesions. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the applied nomenclature, neuroimaging and clinical features, and differential diagnoses as well as associated disease entities of CLOCC. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search in three biomedical databases identified 441 references, out of which 324 were eligible for a narrative summary including a total of 1353 patients. Results: Our PRISMA-conform systematic review identifies a broad panel of disease entities which are associated with CLOCC, among them toxic/drug-treatment-associated, infectious (viral, bacterial), vascular, metabolic, traumatic, and neoplastic entities in both adult and pediatric individuals. On MRI, CLOCC show typical high T2 signal, low T1 signal, restricted diffusion, and lack of contrast enhancement. The majority of the lesions were reversible within the follow-up period (median follow-up 3 weeks). Interestingly, even though CLOCC were mostly associated with symptoms of the underlying disease, in exceptional cases, CLOCC were associated with callosal neurological symptoms. Of note, employed nomenclature for CLOCC was highly inconsistent. Conclusions: Our study provides high-level evidence for clinical and imaging features of CLOCC as well as associated disease entities. Clinical relevance statement: Our study provides high-level evidence on MRI features of CLOCC as well as a comprehensive list of disease entities potentially associated with CLOCC. Together, this will facilitate rigorous diagnostic workup of suspected CLOCC cases. Key Points: • Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) are a frequent MRI feature associated with various systemic diseases. • Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum show a highly homogenous MRI presentation and temporal dynamics. • This comprehensive overview will benefit (neuro)radiologists during diagnostic workup.

N2  - Introduction: Telemedicine use in prenatal care has greatly expanded without substantial research. Optimizing user experiences can increase telemedicine's utilization to support care access. The purpose of this study was to explore patient and provider experiences using telemedicine for routine prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying factors affecting its utilization and satisfaction. Methods: In this mixed methods study, online surveys and semi-structured interviews with pregnant and postpartum patients and perinatal providers across the United States were used to explore experiences with telemedicine and prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from July to December 2021. Survey findings were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and interviews were thematically coded and analyzed, followed by mixed methods analysis. Results: Results of 946 surveys (750 patients and 196 providers) and 30 interviews (15 patients and 15 providers) met inclusion for analysis. Telemedicine was utilized by 42% of patients and 72% of perinatal provider participants. The primary reason patients did not use telemedicine was because it was not offered. Patients and providers who did not use telemedicine expressed the following main concerns with virtual care: uncertainty about care quality, particularly when blood pressure and the fetal heart rate were not assessed, and potential challenges with developing trusting patient-provider relationships. Patients and providers who used telemedicine rated their experience as mild to moderate satisfaction across the 6 Telehealth Usability Questionnaire domains. Satisfaction scores were not dependent on whether physical examination components were included in virtual visits. Discussion: Providing patients with the choice to use telemedicine as needed or combined with in-person visits for routine prenatal care may increase care utilization. Although not directly linked with satisfaction, interest in using telemedicine would likely increase for patients and providers concerned with care quality if blood pressure and fetal heart rate are assessed during virtual visits.

N2  - Objective: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is an underestimated chronic disease. It can cause significant symptom burden and sexual dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction and current challenges in the management of VLS in a certified dysplasia unit, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This survey analyzed patients who had been diagnosed with VLS and treated at our DKG-certified dysplasia unit. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the University of Aachen. The questionnaire contained 43 questions on general treatment, diagnostic delays, disease education, psychologic and sexual issues, and specific questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaires were distributed between January 2021 and September 2023. Results: This study included 103 patients diagnosed with VLS, who were treated at our certified dysplasia unit. Overall, 48% of the patients were satisfied with the success of the therapy. Most participants reported psychologic problems (36.8%), fear of cancer (53.3%), or sexual restrictions (53.3%). Among the patients, 38% were bothered by the regular application of topical cortisone. However, 72% were willing to undergo treatment for more than 24 months. The COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 had a significant negative impact on general VLS care from the patient’s perspective (3.83/5 before vs. 3.67/5 after; p = 0.046). There was a general request for booklets to inform and educate the patients about their disease. Furthermore, the respondents demanded a telephone hotline to answer the questions and wished for follow-up visits via e-mail to cope better with their current situation. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for more effective treatments for VLS and an increased awareness of psychologic and sexual distress. To ensure patient well-being and satisfaction, it is imperative to offer individualized care with adequate disease education in a team of specialists from various disciplines.

N2  - Early infant development is a maturation process critically depends on the infant's interaction with primary caregivers. Hence, neonatal units prioritize their proximity. In COVID-19, parental visitation hours were limited, reducing caregivers time with their infants. This follow-up study analyzes and compares levels of maternal depression and stress, infant development, and bonding quality in preterm mother-infant dyads hospitalized, before and during the pandemic. Out of 66 dyads participated, 36 were admitted before COVID-19, and 30 during COVID-19. The assessed was two video-call sessions in which mothers completed selected questionnaires. No significant differences between mothers' levels of depression and stress. However, low birth weight was associated with greater difficulties in children's communication and interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, infants hospitalized in COVID-19 had a higher risk of experiencing delayed communication. No significant differences were observed in bonding quality. Lower infant gestational age and longer breastfeeding time were associated with better bonding quality in both groups. Psychosocial intervention is considered a valuable tool, capable of preventing maternal mental health difficulties and protecting bonding in premature infants and in highly complex healthcare settings. Nevertheless, it is essential to more actively address the socio-affective needs of newborns during their hospital stay to promote adequate development.

N2  - Postpartum hypertension (PPHT) is hypertension that persists or develops after delivery and is a frequent cause of readmission, affecting 10% of pregnancies. This interim analysis aims to describe the cohort and to determine the feasibility and acceptance of a home-based telemonitoring management strategy (HBTMS) in PPHT patients. Enrollment at the University Hospital Basel began during the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Maternity-ward patients were screened for preexisting hypertension, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and de novo PPHT. In this pragmatic non-randomized prospective trial, the participants chose the HBTMS or standard of care (SOC), which consisted of outpatient hypertension clinic appointments. The HBTMS was a smartphone application or a programmed spreadsheet to report blood pressure (BP), followed by telephone consultations. Three months postpartum, the participants underwent a 24 h BP measurement and a blood, biomarker, and urine analysis. A total of 311 participants were enrolled between 06/20 and 08/23. The mean age was 34 (±5.3) years. The current pregnancy history demonstrated the following (≥1 diagnosis possible): 10% had preexisting hypertension, 27.3% gestational hypertension, 53% preeclampsia (PE), 0.3% eclampsia, 6% HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), and 18.3% de novo PPHT. A family history of cardiovascular disease and PE was reported in 49.5% and 7.5%, respectively. In total, 23.3% were high-risk for PE. A total of 68.5% delivered via c-section, the mean hospitalization was 6.3 days (±3.9), and newborn intrauterine growth restriction occurred in 21%. A total of 99% of the participants chose the HBTMS. This analysis demonstrated that the HBTMS was accepted. This is vital in the immediate postpartum period and pertinent when the exposure of hospital visits should be avoided.

N2  - Vaccination among pregnant and breastfeeding women is critical for protecting this vulnerable population and their children. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended both during pregnancy and breastfeeding; however, we still do not fully understand the determinants that influence hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination. This study aimed to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy in pregnant and breastfeeding, puerperium women. A multicenter, cross-sectional study, involving 435 pregnant and breastfeeding women, was conducted. Vaccination hesitancy was evaluated by administering the Vaccination Attitudes (VAX) Scale and the Zung Anxiety Self-Assessment Scale (SAS) was adopted to measure anxiety levels. Overall, 14% of the participants reported that they did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and 78.3% received their first dose during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. The descriptive statistics for the VAX scale showed a total mean score of 3.35 (±1.6), and 75% of participants reported an anxiety index equal to or lower than the threshold. Vaccine hesitancy increased as “adverse events after vaccination” increased (p < 0.01), while SAS levels positively correlated with the participants’ mean age (p < 0.05). Investigating the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy enables the development of targeted health policies and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated fears and anxieties, potentially influencing maternal perinatal mental health. This study addresses a gap in the literature on fear of COVID-19 in pregnant women, aiming to identify contributing factors. Method: Participants were 401 primiparous women with an average age of 34 years (SD = 4.56) who were recruited through the National Health System during birth support courses. They completed a series of self-reported instruments via an online survey, providing information on their levels of reflective functioning, dyadic consensus, perinatal maternal affectivity, and fear of COVID-19. Pearson’s correlation and mediation analysis via a generalized linear model were implemented to analyze the collected data. Results: The relationship between dyadic consensus and fear of COVID-19 was significant and negative. Furthermore, a significant parallel mediation involving perinatal maternal affectivity and reflective functioning was found to the extent that, when these factors were inserted into the model, the direct association between dyadic consensus and fear of COVID-19 became non-significant (total mediation). Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of dyadic adjustment in alleviating maternal COVID-19 fear, emphasizing interventions promoting couple functioning, mentalization, and addressing affective difficulties. Such approaches are vital for supporting expecting mothers during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Background: Türkiye hosted more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees, including women who needed reproductive health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: To assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected access to and use of essential reproductive health services by Syrian refugee women in Ankara, Türkiye. Methods: From April to December 2021, this descriptive epidemiological study collected data from 637 ever-married Syrian refugee women aged 15–49 years in 2 districts of Ankara, Türkiye. The data were collected using a structured multiple-choice questionnaire and analysed using SPSS version 23. Results: The mean age of the women was 29.6 (SD±8.4) years, with a median first-marriage age of 17 (range 12–45) years. Among them, 8.6% were illiterates and 96.7% had ever been pregnant. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 35.6% of them had been pregnant, with 78.2% livebirths and 21.8% miscarriages. Alarmingly, 12.8% gave birth at home without specialist support. Absence of antenatal care increased from 7.0% before to 41.1% after the pandemic, and missed postpartum assessment increased from 10.6% to 45.1%. Due to the fear of side effects or spousal disapproval, 26.4% never used any contraceptive. Hospitals and migrant health centres were the primary reproductive health information sources. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected access to reproductive health services for Syrian refugee women in Ankara, Türkiye. The increased rate of missed antenatal and postpartum care and number of home-based pregnancy terminations are causes for serious concern. Urgent policy adjustments and targeted interventions are needed to address these concerns.

N2  - Background: Few studies have evaluated postnatal anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTS) before and during the Covid-19 pandemic using comparable data across time. We used data from two national maternity surveys in England to explore the impact of the pandemic on prevalence and risk factors for postnatal anxiety and PTS. Methods: Analysis was conducted using population-based surveys carried out in 2018 (n = 4509) and 2020 (n = 4611). Weighted prevalence estimates for postnatal anxiety and PTS were compared across surveys. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were estimated for the association between risk factors and postnatal anxiety and PTS. Findings: Prevalence of postnatal anxiety increased from 13.7 % in 2018 to 15.1 % in 2020 (+1.4 %(95%CI:-0.4–3.1)). Prevalence of postnatal PTS increased from 9.7 % in 2018 to 11.5 % in 2020 (+1.8 %(95%CI:0.3–3.4)), due to an increase in PTS related to birth trauma from 2.5 % to 4.3 % (+1.8 %(95%CI:0.9–2.6); there was no increase in PTS related to non-birth trauma. Younger age (aRR = 1.31–1.51), being born in the UK (aRR = 1.29–1.59), long-term physical or mental health problem(s) (aRR = 1.27–1.94), and antenatal anxiety (aRR = 1.97–2.22) were associated with increased risk of postnatal anxiety and PTS before and during the pandemic, whereas higher satisfaction with birth (aRR = 0.92–0.94) and social support (aRR = 0.81–0.82) were associated with decreased risk. Interpretation: Prevalence of postnatal PTS was significantly higher during the pandemic, compared to before the pandemic, due to an increase in PTS related to birth trauma. Prevalence of postnatal anxiety was not significantly higher during the pandemic. Risk factors for postnatal anxiety and PTS were similar before and during the pandemic.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being classified as a pandemic and has influenced all aspects of human life. Although some groups, such as pregnant women, are at higher risk, the information on COVID-19 effects on pregnancy has remained limited yet. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fetal mortality rate (FMR). The delivery status of all asymptomatic pregnant women hospitalized in 5 hospitals located in Kerman city, Iran, were checked three months before and three months during this pandemic. Results: According to the results, compared to the non-COVID-19, the COVID-19 period increased FMR with an odds ratio of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.14-1.72), meaning that the coronavirus could increase the risk of fetal death by 40%. Conclusion: The evidence suggests that more careful and accurate screening approaches are needed for asymptomatic pregnant individuals to avoid risks to the fetus and mother.

N2  - Problem: The COVID-19 pandemic hindered access to routine healthcare globally, prompting concerns about possible increases in pregnancy loss and perinatal death. Background: PUDDLES is an international collaboration exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on parents who experience pregnancy loss and perinatal death in seven countries, including Aotearoa New Zealand. Aim: To explore parents’ experiences of access to healthcare services and support following baby loss during the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand. Methods: We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 26 bereaved parents, including 20 birthing mothers, and six non-birthing parents (one mother and five fathers). Types of loss included 15 stillbirths, four late miscarriages, and one neonatal death. Participant ethnicities were broadly representative of Aotearoa New Zealand's multi-ethnic society. Data were analysed using Template Analysis. Findings: Analysis revealed five themes relating to pandemic impact on bereaved parent's experiences. These were: ‘Distanced and Impersonal care’; ‘Navigating Hospital Rules’; Exclusion of Non-birthing Parents; ‘Hindered Access to Social Support’; and ‘Continuity of Relational Care’. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated isolation of bereaved parents through perceived impersonal care by healthcare professionals and restrictions on movement hindered access to social and cultural support. Compassionate bending of the rules by healthcare professionals and community postnatal visits by continuity of care midwives following the bereavement appeared to be mitigating factors. Conclusion: Social isolation is an added challenge for parents experiencing baby loss during a pandemic, which may be mitigated by flexible and compassionate care from healthcare professionals, especially continuity of care midwives.

N2  - Problem: Student wellbeing is a global concern in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic. Students in healthcare often are exposed to academic, clinical, and psychosocial factors of stress, in particularly student midwives, as they are exposed to other people's intimate life experiences. The aim of this study was to identify factors which help and hinder student midwives in their studies. Background: Midwifery students in the Netherlands must complete 35–50 % of their bachelor's degree with placements in community and hospital-based maternity care. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted, using the Job-Demands-Resources model. Data were collected through semi-structured individual and group interviews with Bachelor student midwives from the Netherlands. Findings: During coursework students found the high workload and lack of recovery time demanding. During placements, their sense of being constantly assessed, having to be available on call and being away from home were experienced as demands. The relationships with teachers as supportive. Support from their placement supervisors and peers were also resourceful if available and positive. In other cases, peer pressure and grand expectations from supervisors were demanding. Personal demands were setting ambitious standards and feeling alone during their placements, and personal resources were positive attitude towards to becoming a midwife. Discussion: The academic programme for student midwives seemed highly demanding, with a stark difference between the learning environment in the faculty coursework and in the placements. Positive support from placement supervisors in a culture that values learning and development, can contribute to student midwives’ socialization into midwifery.

N2  - Objectives: This study aims to assess the clinical features, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection during pregnancy, and the perinatal and obstetric outcomes in phases I and II. Methods: The current study was performed from January 2020 to August 2021 at the Government T D Medical College, Alappuzha. The pregnant women were registered instantly after each infected woman was known as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic parameters, related comorbid disorders, intensive care unit admission, and complete treatment details of each woman were noted. Neonatal outcomes were documented. Results: There were 254 women in wave 1 and 164 women in wave 2 in the obstetric admissions. Still was seen in 3 cases (wave 1) and 2 cases (wave 2). In both phases, most pregnant women fall under the age category between 21 and 30. Multi-parity was found to be 50.8% in wave 1 women and 59.2% in wave 2 women were common in both waves. The period of gestation and obstetric comorbidities were found to be statistically significant with a p=0.007 (phase I) and 0.008 (phase II). Conclusion: Pregnancy-related COVID-19 infection may increase the threat of maternal death but has no influence on the morbidity and death of newborns. It is not possible to totally rule out the possibility of maternal-fetal transfer. Every wave of COVID-19 may have different characteristics and severity; therefore, our treatment plans must change. To confirm this transmission, more research or meta-analysis reports are needed.

N2  - This study delves into the global evolution of 43 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators, spanning 7 major health themes across 185 countries to evaluate the potential progress loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the cross-country and temporal variability of the dataset are employed to estimate an empirical model based on an extended version of the Preston curve, which links well-being to income levels and other key socioeconomic health determinants. The approach reveals significant global evolution trends operating in each SDG indicator assessed. We extrapolate the model yearly between 2020 and 2030 using the IMF’s pre-COVID-19 economic growth projections to show how each country in the dataset are expected to evolve in these health topics throughout the decade, assuming no other external shocks. The results of this baseline scenario are contrasted with a post-COVID-19 scenario, where most of the pandemic costs were already known. The study reveals that economic growth losses are, on average, estimated as 42% and 28% for low- and lower middle-income countries, and of 15% and 7% in high- and upper middle-income countries, respectively, according to the IMF’s projections. These disproportional figures are shown to exacerbate global health inequalities revealed by the curves. The expected progress loss in infectious diseases in low-income countries, for instance, is an average of 34%, against a mean of 6% in high-income countries. The theme of Infectious diseases is followed by injuries and violence; maternal and reproductive health; health systems coverage; and neonatal and infant health as those with worse performance. Low-income countries can expect an average progress loss of 16% across all health indicators assessed, whereas in high-income countries the estimated loss is as low as 3%. The disparity across countries is even more pronounced, with cases where the estimated progress loss is as high as nine times worse than the average loss of 8%. Conversely, countries with greater fiscal capacity are likely to fare much better under the circumstances, despite their worse death count, in many cases. Overall, these findings support the critical importance of integrating the fight against inequalities into the global development agendas.

N2  - Objective To assess the feasibility of integrating a pregnancy intention assessment screening algorithm into the electronic medical record (EMR) at a multispecialty clinic focused on the health of women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Study design This pilot quality improvement project implemented a series of clinician reminders, new data fields in the patient record, and templated clinical notes to prompt care providers across specialties to ask AFAB reproductive age individuals about their desire for future pregnancies. Investigators created a novel screening question based on prior literature and expert input. Prospective observational study of one year of during-intervention EMR data on screening uptake and documentation, contraceptive use, and referrals to obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) for preconception care, contraceptive care, and related services. Results SUPPORT launched in February 2020 and was paused for 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the intervention period through July 2021, 18% of patients for whom the automated screening reminder was activated had a documented pregnancy intention. Patients were screened in OBGYN, internal medicine, and eight subspecialty medical clinics. Among those screened, individuals who reported they did not desire pregnancy in the next year were more likely to use contraception (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1). Individuals that did desire pregnancy in the next year were more likely to be subsequently referred to OBGYN (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2, 6.0). Conclusions Despite the competing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SUPPORT intervention was utilized at higher rates than prior similar interventions and across multiple disease specialties. Implications Results from the SUPPORT pilot suggest that pregnancy intention screening of reproductive age AFAB individuals with an EMR-based screening prompt is feasible at scale.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study among pregnant and postpartum Black women was twofold: (1) to compare levels of perceived stress, depressive symptoms, social support, and neighborhood disorder and crime before the pandemic vs during the pandemic; and (2) to examine the association of perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and social support with neighborhood disorder and crime at both time points. Methods: This was a prospective study as part of the Biosocial Impact on Black Births, a longitudinal study that examined the role of maternal factors on preterm birth among Black women. A sample of 143 women were included who responded to survey questions during pregnancy prior to the pandemic and again after birth, during the pandemic. Women completed the COVID survey between May 21, 2020, and January 28, 2021. Results: The levels of perceived stress (70.75 and 76.28, respectively, P <.01) and social support (17.01 and 18.78, respectively, P <.01) were lower during the pandemic than prior to the pandemic. Social support, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with the pre-pandemic measures of perceived neighborhood disorder and crime. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were also significantly correlated with pandemic measures of perceived neighborhood. Conclusion: Women reported lower levels of perceived stress during the pandemic than prior to the pandemic, but neighborhood characteristics were consistently associated with perceived stress and depressive symptoms both prior to and during the pandemic. Further exploration is warranted to better understand these relationships.

N2  - Medication abortion has been established globally as safe and effective. This modality has increased accessibility and the opportunity to centre individual autonomy at the heart of abortion care, by facilitating self-managed abortion. Previous research has shown how self-managed abortion is beneficial in myriad settings ranging from problematic to (relatively) unproblematic contexts of access. In this paper we explore the relationship between self-management and sources of support (including health professionals, family, and friends); as well as considering issues of reproductive control and autonomy. Drawing on qualitative, experience-centred interviews, we utilise the concept of social connectedness to examine how supported self-managed abortion was experienced in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, self-management was welcomed, with participants speaking positively about managing their own abortion at home. However, a sense of connectedness was crucial in helping participants deal with difficult experiences; and functioned to support individual autonomy in self-care. This paper is the first to examine factors of connection, support, and isolation, as experienced by those undergoing self-managed abortion in the UK in detail. Our research suggests a continued need to advocate for high quality support for self-managed abortion, as well as for choice of abortion method, to support patient-centered care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of women with histories of depression who used a responsive infant bassinet during the first 6 months after birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Secondary qualitative descriptive study with analytic expansion. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Women (N = 139) who gave birth up to 6 months previously and had histories of depression. METHODS: We used Kyngäs's method of inductive content analysis to analyze 109 open-ended responses that were collected between August 2020 to November 2021 as part of a previously conducted longitudinal study of women who used a responsive bassinet. RESULTS: Most participants indicated that the responsive bassinet improved their infants' sleep, which, in turn, subjectively improved their sleep and mood. External stressors and challenges presented barriers to good sleep for the participants and their infants, and participants described how these challenges contributed to their symptoms related to mood. When participants reported that they used the responsive bassinet, they shared that their infants were swaddled in the supine sleep position. Participants who did not use the bassinet commonly reported unsafe sleep practices. We identified seven themes from the data: Improved Maternal Sleep Quality, Barriers to Good Maternal Sleep, Mood and Sleep Go Hand and Hand, External Stressors Impair Mood, Improved Infant Sleep Quality, Barriers to Good Infant Sleep, and Safe Sleep Positioning. CONCLUSION: These findings can be used to inform clinicians on how a responsive bassinet may offer women at high risk for postpartum depression improved sleep and instrumental support. Future researchers should use validated measures to objectively evaluate rates of postpartum depression and sleep quality in high-risk women when using a responsive bassinet.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of antenatal follow-up using telehealth in the pre-COVID-19 and active pandemic periods. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: Searches were conducted from inception to September 2023 through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EBSCO, Embase, Web of Science, all via Ovid SP, the National Thesis Center, TR Index, Turkiye Clinics, and DergiPark Academic. Data were combined in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. RESULTS: The meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of antenatal telehealth services included 35 studies with a total sample size of 16 033. The combined results of the studies revealed that antenatal telehealth services were similar to face-to-face follow-ups for many maternal and newborn health outcomes. Maternal outcomes included abortion, preterm delivery, gestational diabetes, weight gain, hypertensive disorders, maternal hospitalization, number of antenatal follow-ups, use of induction, vaginal and instrumental delivery, planned and emergency cesarean section, shoulder dystocia, episiotomy, perineal laceration, childbirth under the supervision of qualified personnel, breastfeeding problems and postpartum depression. Neonatal outcomes included an APGAR score of <7, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, admission into the neonatal intensive care unit, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal death, birth weight, low birth weight and macrosomia. However, statistically significant reductions in excessive weight gain (p<0.001) and a 1.23-fold increase in vaccination administration (p=0.001) were observed with telehealth services. Additionally, the effects of telehealth services on preterm and cesarean delivery rates were similar in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: This review reveals that while antenatal telehealth services are comparable to face-to-face care in terms of multiple pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes, they contribute to improvements in preventing extreme weight gain and vaccination hesitancy. These findings suggest that the telehealth method can be used as an alternative to face-to-face monitoring in antenatal follow-ups.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization posits that adequate maternity health is possible if midwives are supported, respected, protected, motivated, and equipped to work safely and optimally within interdisciplinary health care teams. Based on qualitative survey data, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic amplified job demands and resources, professional invisibility, and gender norms to negatively impact midwives' well-being. PURPOSES: We aim to develop a refined understanding of the antecedents of well-being in midwifery to equip policymakers, administrators, and professional associations with the knowledge to enhance midwives' well-being postpandemic. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources model, we thematically analyzed qualitative survey data ( N = 215) from New Zealand midwives to reveal how job demands, resources, and structural factors impacted midwives' well-being. RESULTS: We identified fear of contracting and spreading COVID-19, financial and legal imperatives (job demands), work-related hypervigilance, sense of professional duty, practical and social support, and appreciation and recognition (job resources) as key antecedents of midwives' well-being. These job demands and resources were influenced by professional invisibility and gender norms. CONCLUSION: Policy and practice solutions must address job demands, resources, and structural factors to meaningfully enhance midwives' well-being postpandemic. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: We recommend that policymakers, administrators, and professional associations monitor for signs of overcommitment and perfectionistic strivings and then take appropriate remedial action. We also suggest that midwives receive equitable pay, sick leave, and other related benefits.

N2  - Depression is associated with lower adherence to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV, but data are not currently available on how depression may affect use of other HIV prevention methods including the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR). We conducted a mixed methods study using data from the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) 042/DELIVER (n = 558) and MTN-043/B-PROTECTED (n = 197) studies to describe the prevalence of depressive symptoms and explore how depressive symptoms may have influenced attitudes about use of the monthly DVR and once-daily oral PrEP tablet among pregnant and breastfeeding persons, respectively, in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Eleven participants had high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scores ≥ 10 in MTN-042/DELIVER (2%) and four participants (2%) in MTN-043/B-PROTECTED. In interviews with 9 participants who had high scores (6 DVR, 3 oral PrEP), those with depressive symptoms described overlapping stressors which were magnified by job loss and economic instability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by experiences of pregnancy/postpartum. These participants experienced a lack of support from partners or family members, and conflict with partners related to trust, and infidelity. While we did not find evidence of a change in product adherence, there was a strong sense of commitment and motivation to use the study products for protection from HIV for participants themselves and their baby. Although lack of social support is usually an obstacle to adherence, in this study, the participants' lives and relationships seemed to have reinforced the need for HIV prevention and motivated women to protect themselves and their babies from HIV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the experiences of registered nurses and certified nurse midwives who provided labor support and care in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative approach was used to explore nurses' and midwives' perceptions via in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen nurses, four of whom were also midwives, participated in semi-structured interviews. All provided care during the first 9 months of the pandemic and represented seven states across the United States. The analysis revealed an overarching theme, A New World but still a Celebration. This overarching theme encompasses participants' accounts of trying to provide the same support, presence, and celebration while dealing with constant policy changes, the impact of limited family presence in labor, and their own fears and risks. Four sub-themes were identified: The Impact of Nursing during COVID-19; Challenges, Changes, and Consequences; Unexpected Benefits; and The Cost. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic saw unprecedented challenges for nurses. Practice changes due to these changing policies had negative and positive effects. Negative practices affected family support, decreased interprofessional collaboration, and caused shorter hospital stays for new mothers. Some positive aspects of practice changes included additional time for mother-newborn bonding due to restrictive visitation policies, increased initiation of breastfeeding, and focused patient education. Nurses across the United States are still coping with practice changes from the pandemic. Our study highlights the need to support nurses in adapting care in the midst of practice changes.

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extreme strain on health systems including the health workforce, essential health services and vaccination coverage. We examined disruptions to immunisation and maternal and child health (MCH) services, concerns of personal well-being and delivery of healthcare during the pandemic as well as factors associated with self-reported trauma or burnout among healthcare providers (HCPs). Methods In March-April 2022, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among HCPs in two provinces of Indonesia. HCPs involved in COVID-19 or routine immunisation and MCH services were randomly selected from district/city health office registration lists. We descriptively analysed service disruptions experienced by HCPs as well as trauma, burnout and concerns of personal well-being and delivery of healthcare during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify factors associated with trauma or burnout. Results We recruited 604 HCPs. Mobilisation of staff from routine health services to COVID-19 response duties was a key reason for service disruptions (87.9%). Strategies such as community outreach and task shifting were implemented to overcome disruptions. Trauma or burnout during the pandemic was reported by 64.1% HCPs, with 23.5% reporting worse mental or emotional health. Factors associated with trauma or burnout included delivery of COVID-19 immunisation (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.94); and delivery of both COVID-19 immunisation and routine immunisation compared with no involvement in vaccination programmes (aOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.52); poor treatment in the workplace (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.38) and lower confidence to respond to patient queries on COVID-19 immunisation (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.22). Conclusion HCPs experienced service disruptions, trauma and burnout and implemented strategies to minimise disruptions to service delivery and improve patient experiences. Our study highlights the need to ensure that workforce resilience and strategies to protect and support HCPs are considered for pandemic planning, preparedness and management.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has raised a wide range of challenges for qualitative researchers, especially when most of the world was facing isolation during the first wave in 2020. The scientific literature rapidly raised discussion regarding data collection adaptation for remote inquiry and ethical dilemmas. However, it is still necessary to discuss the implications of running qualitative studies as a researcher immersed in a global emergency, precisely when the researchers themselves are involved in this context. To what extent, or in what way, can being fully immersed in this context influence all phases of the research? What is the role of reflexivity in this context? We proposed a new discussion based on the study we performed remotely in 2020, among infected pregnant women, using concepts of the Freudian feeling of uncanny to explore the life experience of the researcher. We also considered the concept of the discourse of the master from Jacques Lacan to debate the researchers' position during the pandemic and to bring practical implications.

N2  - Schizophrenia develops during adolescence. Maternal infections during the fetal period increase the incidence of schizophrenia in children, which suggests that the pathogenesis involves neuroinflammation. Here, we report a case of new-onset schizophrenia in a 16-year-old boy after COVID-19. After developing COVID-19, he entered a catatonic state 4 days later and was hospitalized. Benzodiazepines alleviated his catatonia, but hallucinations and delusions persisted. Encephalitis and epilepsy were excluded by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), encephalography, and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Psychosis persisted after the virus titer declined and the inflammatory response subsided. Moreover, the patient exhibited delusions of control-a Schneider's first-rank symptom. Schizophrenia was diagnosed, and olanzapine improved his symptoms. He had a brief history of insomnia before COVID-19 but his symptoms did not satisfy the ultra-high-risk criteria. However, COVID-19 may have facilitated development of schizophrenia through neuroinflammation and volume reduction in the gray matter of the right medial temporal lobe. This case demonstrates that infectious diseases in adolescents should be carefully managed, to prevent schizophrenia.

N2  - Background: People with multiple and persistent physical symptoms have impaired quality of life and poor experiences of health care. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based symptom-clinic intervention in people with multiple and persistent physical symptoms, hypothesising that this symptoms clinic plus usual care would be superior to usual care only. Methods: The Multiple Symptoms Study 3 was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, individually randomised controlled trial conducted in 108 general practices in the UK National Health Service in four regions of England between Dec 6, 2018, and June 30, 2023. Participants were individually randomised (1:1) to the symptom-clinic intervention plus usual care or to usual care only via a computer-generated, pseudo-random list stratified by trial centre. Allocation was done by the trial statistician and concealed with a centralised, web-based randomisation system; masking participants was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. The symptom-clinic intervention was a sequence of up to four medical consultations that aimed to elicit a detailed clinical history, fully hear and validate the participant, offer rational explanations for symptoms, and assist the participant to develop ways of managing their symptoms; it was delivered by general practitioners with an extended role. The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) score 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN57050216). Findings: 354 participants were randomly assigned; 178 (50%) were assigned to receive the community-based symptoms clinic plus usual care and 176 (50%) were assigned to receive usual care only. At the primary-outcome point of 52 weeks, PHQ-15 scores were 14·1 (SD 3·7) in the group receiving usual care and 12·2 (4·5) in the group receiving the intervention. The adjusted between-group difference of –1·82 (95% CI –2·67 to –0·97) was statistically significantly in favour of the intervention group (p<0·0001). There were 39 adverse events in the group receiving usual care and 36 adverse events in the group receiving the intervention. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the proportion of participants who had non-serious adverse events (–0·03, 95% CI –0·11 to 0·05) or serious adverse events (0·02, –0·02 to 0·07). No serious adverse event was deemed to be related to the trial intervention. Interpretation: Our symptom-clinic intervention, which focused on explaining persistent symptoms to participants in order to support self-management, led to sustained improvement in multiple and persistent physical symptoms.

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had challenged health systems worldwide, including those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Aside from measures to control the pandemic, efforts were made to continue the provision and use of essential services. At that time, information was not organised and readily available to guide country-level decision-making. This review aims to summarise evaluated interventions to maintain essential services for maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health in response to COVID-19 in LMICs, in order to learn from the interventions and facilitate their use in the next disruption. Methods: We conducted a scoping review by Embase, MEDLINE, and Global Health for literature published between 1 January 2020 and 26 December 2022, without restrictions for language. We extracted information about the setting, population targeted, service type, intervention, and evaluation from the included studies and summarised it both quantitatively and narratively. Results: We retrieved 11 395 unique references and included 30 studies describing 32 evaluated interventions. Most interventions (84%) were implemented in 2020, with a median duration of five months (interquartile range (IQR) = 3-8), and were conducted in Africa (34%) or Southeast Asia (31%). Interventions focussed on maintaining services for maternal and newborn health (56%) or children and adolescents (56%) were most common. Interventions aimed to address problems related to access (94%), fear (31%), health workers shortage (25%), and vulnerability (22%). Types of interventions included telehealth (69%), protocols/guidelines to adapt care provision (56%), and health education (40%); a few entailed health worker training (16%). The described interventions were mostly led by the public (56%) or non-profit (34%) sectors. Methodologies of their evaluations were heterogeneous; the majority used quantitative methods, had a prospective research design, and used output- and outcome-based indicators. Conclusions: In this review, we identified an important and growing body of evidence of evaluated interventions to maintain essential services for maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health during COVID-19 in LMICs. To improve preparedness and responsiveness for future disruptions, managers for decision-makers in LMICs could benefit from up-to-date inventories describing implemented interventions and evaluations to facilitate evidence-based implementation of strategies, as well as tools for conducting optimal quality operational and implementation research during disruptions (e.g. rapid ethical approvals, access to routine data).

N2  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a recurrent, persistent, and debilitating neuropsychiatric syndrome with an increasing morbidity and mortality, representing the leading cause of disability worldwide. The dysregulation of immune systems (including innate and adaptive immune systems) has been identified as one of the key contributing factors in the progression of MDD. As the main force of the humoral immunity, B cells have an essential role in the defense against infections, antitumor immunity and autoimmune diseases. Several recent studies have suggested an intriguing connection between disturbances in B cell homeostasis and the pathogenesis of MDD, however, the B-cell-dependent mechanism of MDD remains largely unexplored compared to other immune cells. In this review, we provide an overview of how B cell abnormality regulates the progression of MMD and the potential consequence of the disruption of B cell homeostasis in patients with MDD. Abnormalities of B-cell homeostasis not only promote susceptibility to MDD, but also lead to an increased risk of developing infection, malignancy and autoimmune diseases in patients with MDD. A better understanding of the contribution of B cells underlying MDD would provide opportunities for identification of more targeted treatment approaches and might provide an overall therapeutic benefit to improve the long-term outcomes of patients with MDD.

N2  - Objective: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine for pregnant persons to prevent severe illness and death. The objective was to examine levels of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG, IgM, and IgA against spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) in maternal and infant/cord blood at delivery after COVID 19 vaccination compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection at in mother-infant dyads at specified time points. Study Design: Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 31) or COVID-19 vaccination (n = 25) during pregnancy were enrolled between July 2020 and November 2021. Samples were collected at delivery and IgG, IgM, and IgA to RBD of spike and NCPs compared in the infected and vaccinated groups. Timing of infection/vaccination prior to delivery and correlation with antibody levels was performed. Results: The majority of participants received vaccination within 90 days of delivery and over half received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. There were no significant correlations between antibody levels and timing of infection or vaccination. Infant IgG levels to the RBD domain of spike protein were higher in the vaccinated group (n = 25) as compared with the infants born to mothers with infection (n = 31). Vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy was associated with detectable maternal and infant anti-RBD IgG levels at delivery irrespective of the timing of vaccination. Conclusion: Timing of vaccination had no correlation to the antibody levels suggesting that the timing of maternal vaccination in the cohort did not matter. There was no IgM detected in infants from vaccinated mothers. Infants from vaccinated mothers had robust IgG titers to RBD, which have a lasting protective effect in infants.

N2  - There is increasing evidence that prenatal stress elevates the risk of children’s social–emotional development, but the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Home environment provides learning opportunities and stimulation required for children's early development and can be influenced by prenatal maternal stress. This study aimed to examine whether home environment can mediate the association between prenatal stress during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their offspring’s social–emotional problems thereafter. A pilot sample was derived from 2020 to 2021 Maternal and Child Health Cohort study (N = 82) with the pregnant women recruited during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020. Prenatal stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Home environment was measured using the Child Home Nurture Environment Scales. Mother-reported toddler social–emotional problems were assessed at 12 months of age. The mediation model was used for data analysis. The mean scores of social–emotional problems, which include externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation, and competence, were 10.98 (5.08), 14.72 (6.49), 15.15 (6.31), and 36.73 (10.26), respectively. Prenatal stress, home environment, and social–emotional problems were significantly related (P < 0.05). Home environment significantly mediated the association between prenatal stress and social–emotional problems with the indirect effect [95% CI] of 0.06 [0.01, 0.14] for externalizing behaviors, 0.10 [0.00, 0.24] for internalizing behaviors, − 0.15 [− 0.31, − 0.01] for competence, 0.08 [0.01, 0.17] and 0.08 [0.01, 0.21] for dysregulation. These findings suggest that prenatal stress may affect offspring’s social–emotional problems through the home environment. Screening for prenatal stress and promoting supportive home environment may be potential strategies for social–emotional problems interventions in children.

N2  - Early interventions may promote reductions in mothers’ anxiety-depression (AD) symptoms and improvements in their offspring. This longitudinal randomized research was conducted to assess the effects of interdisciplinary online therapeutic groups (GIO) in at-risk mothers and babies during the COVID-19 pandemic in a disadvantaged neighborhood in Barcelona (Spain). A total of 135 babies were born from March 2020 to June 2021 in a primary healthcare center of Barcelona (Spain). Pregnant woman and new mothers were screened for AD symptomatology through EPDS and STAI questionnaires. Seventy-two of them met high-risk criteria for AD and were included in the study. They were randomly assigned into the two groups of the study: 40 participants were assigned to GIO, the therapeutic group (TG), while 32 of them were assigned to the control group (CG) and received treatment as usual. The course of the mothers’ symptomatology was assessed, as well as the baby’s development at 6 months old in a blind pediatric follow-up. No differences were found in AD between both groups before the intervention. However, we obtained a significant decrease in AD symptomatology (EPDS p <.001; STAI state p =.015 and STAI trait p <.001at 6 months of life) after the intervention in the TG compared to the CG. Pediatric follow-up at 6 months demonstrated significant differences between groups in babies’ development assessment (manipulation p =.003; language p <.001; sociability p <.001). The GIO helped to ensure healthy development of the baby and reduction of the mothers’ depressive-anxiety symptomatology.

N2  - Remdesivir (RDV) is the mainstay antiviral therapy for moderate to severe COVID-19. Although remdesivir was the first drug approved for COVID-19, information about its efficacy and safety profile is limited in a significant segment of the population, such as people with underlying diseases, the elderly, children, and pregnant and lactating women. The efficacy and safety profile of RDV in disease progression, renal impairment, liver impairment, immunosuppression, geriatrics, pediatrics, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in COVID-19 patients was evaluated. The databases searched included Embase, Scopus, and PubMed. Only English language studies enrolling specific subpopulations with COVID-19 and treated with RDV were included. Thirty-nine clinical trials, cohorts, cross-sectional studies, and case series/reports were included. Most supported the benefits of RDV therapy for COVID-19 patients, such as lessening the duration of hospitalization, alleviating respiratory complications, and reducing mortality. Adverse effects of RDV, including liver and kidney impairment, were, for the most part, moderate to mild, supporting the safety profile of RDV therapy. RDV therapy was well tolerated, no new safety signals were detected, and liver function test abnormalities were the most common adverse events. Moreover, RDV, for the most part, was effective in managing the complications of COVID-19 and reducing mortality in these patients, except for patients with kidney impairment. Future studies, including RCTs, should include these subpopulations of patients to avoid delays associated with receiving proper medication through compassionate use programs.

N2  - Background: Zuranolone, an oral version of allopregnanolone and neurosteroid, is a novel drug for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD). Aim: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of zuranolone in the treatment of MDD and PPD. Method: A systematic search was conducted using EBSCOhost to simultaneously search Academic Search Premier, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL Ultimate, and MEDLINE with Full Text. Two independent reviewers screened the articles and completed a full-text review using Covidence. The quality of each study was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). A meta-analysis was then conducted using Review Manager (RevMan v5.4) software. Results: The initial search yielded 127 results, with 6 articles fitting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 6 studies, comprising 1707 participants, had an overall low risk of bias. There was a significant decrease in HAM-D scores for MDD at 15 days versus placebo (MD − 2.40, 95% CI − 3.07 to − 1.63; p <.001). When pooling data for PDD, there was an overall significant decrease in HAM-D scores at 15 days versus placebo (MD − 4.06, 95% CI − 4.25 to − 3.87; p <.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that zuranolone can improve symptoms of PPD at 15 days; however, results were not clinically significant for MDD. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of zuranolone in PPD and the treatment efficacy in MDD.

N2  - Objective: To understand what concerns and experiences people with vaginismus share online anonymously but may not share with clinicians. Methods: Two researchers compiled all comments and posts made from November 2019 to April 2020 within an online vaginismus forum (n = 311) for content analysis. Two researchers separately performed inductive coding, categorized quotes into overarching categories and codes, and resolved inconsistencies with a third-party adjudicator. Results: Our analysis highlighted three key categories: “psychosocial concerns” (34%), “discussion of pain” (33%), and “lack of access to vulvovaginal healthcare” (34%). The category “psychosocial concerns” comprised of the codes “shame and/or social isolation” (12%), “mental health comorbidities” (9%), “fear of partner separation” (7%), “cultural/religious stigma” (2%), “partner separation” (2%), and “fear of infertility or vaginal delivery” (1%). The category “discussion of pain” comprised of the codes “successful therapies” (16%), “sexual pain” (9%), “nonsexual pain” (6%), and “unsuccessful therapies” (2%). The category “lack of access to vulvovaginal healthcare” comprised of the codes “lack of standardized therapy guidelines” (8%), “self diagnosis” (7%), “fertility testing and/or treatments limited by vaginismus” (5%), “clinicians dismissing symptoms” (4%), “inadequate clinician knowledge about vaginismus” (2%), “inadequate health and sex education in schools” (2%), “geographical barriers” (2%), and “COVID-19” (2%). Conclusion: This novel qualitative study of an online vaginismus forum highlights the need for a patient-centered approach to inform future research, medical education, and clinical practice. Our findings suggest we reevaluate the standard of care for patients with vaginismus and expand on existing knowledge of the impact of sexual health stigma on social and health outcomes.

N2  - In 2023, seventy novel drugs received market authorization for the first time in either Europe (by the EMA and the MHRA) or in the United States (by the FDA). Confirming a steady recent trend, more than half of these drugs target rare diseases or intractable forms of cancer. Thirty drugs are categorized as “first-in-class” (FIC), illustrating the quality of research and innovation that drives new chemical entity discovery and development. We succinctly describe the mechanism of action of most of these FIC drugs and discuss the therapeutic areas covered, as well as the chemical category to which these drugs belong. The 2023 novel drug list also demonstrates an unabated emphasis on polypeptides (recombinant proteins and antibodies), Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (gene and cell therapies) and RNA therapeutics, including the first-ever approval of a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-editing cell therapy.

N2  - Aim: To describe the perceptions and experiences of key stakeholders to understand the use of telehealth in community mental health centers (CMHCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima and Callao, Peru. Methods: A qualitative study was carried out in four CMHCs in Lima and Callao, Peru. Forty-nine individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between September 2021 and March 2022, considering CMHCs' users and their relatives, health and administrative workers, directors, as well as local and national policymakers. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Regarding the transition from in-person care to telehealth, CMHCs' directors and workers identified some of the regulations issued by the Government during the pandemic, such as the continuity of care through telehealth, especially for pregnant women and for people with comorbidities related to COVID-19. Regarding benefits, workers and users indicated that it allowed better communication, such as constant follow-ups. Directors and workers recognized that Google Drive facilitated access to user information, since they did not have an electronic medical record. Additionally, workers said they used social media to share educational information on mental health, and explained that some new users began their treatment this way. Regarding difficulties, participants reported a lack of devices and poor internet connection in CMHCs. Users mentioned that scheduling an appointment was difficult because the phone lines were usually saturated, and they could not find available appointments. Conclusion: Although the pandemic forced an immediate and disruptive change towards telehealth, CMHCs were able to adapt most of their services. This study reports the adaptations made by CMHCs to move from in-person to remote care, identifying the benefits and challenges faced, information that can be used for the nationwide implementation of telehealth in CMHCs. We recommend ensuring technological equipment and internet connection and adapt the telehealth system to make it responsive to the routine practices of CMHCs.

N2  - Purpose of Review: This review provides the most recent update of metformin, a biguanide oral antihyperglycemic drug used as a first-line treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent Findings: Metformin continues to dominate in the world of antidiabetics, and its use will continue to rise because of its high efficiency and easy availability. Apart from type 2 diabetes, research is exploring its potential in other conditions such as cancer, memory loss, bone disorders, immunological diseases, and aging. Summary: Metformin is the most prescribed oral antidiabetic worldwide. It has been in practical use for the last six decades and continues to be the preferred drug for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. It reduces glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production, reducing intestinal glucose absorption, and increasing insulin sensitivity. It can be used as monotherapy or combined with other antidiabetics like sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or insulin, improving its efficacy. Metformin can be used once or twice daily, depending on requirements. Prolonged usage of metformin may lead to abdominal discomfort, deficiency of Vitamin B12, or lactic acidosis. It should be used carefully in patients with renal impairment. Recent studies have explored additional benefits of metformin in polycystic ovarian disease, gestational diabetes mellitus, cognitive disorders, and immunological diseases. However, more extensive studies are needed to confirm these additional benefits.

N2  - Rationale: The shift toward virtual academic detailing (AD) was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims and Objectives: We aimed to examine the role of external, contextual, and intrinsic programme-specific factors in virtual engagement of healthcare providers (HCPs) and delivery of AD. Methods: AD groups throughout North America were contacted to participate in semistructured interviews. An interview guide was constructed by adapting the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A point of emphasis included strategies AD groups employed for provider engagement while implementing virtual AD programmes. Independent coders conducted qualitative analysis using the framework method. Results: Fifteen AD groups from Canada (n = 3) and the United States (n = 12) participated. Technological issues and training detailers and HCPs were challenges during the transition to virtual AD visits. Restrictions on in-person activities during the pandemic created difficulties engaging HCPs and fewer AD visits. Continuing education was one strategy to incentivize participation, but credits were often not claimed by HCPs. Groups with established networks and prior experience with virtual AD leveraged connections to mitigate disruptions and continue AD visits. Other facilitators included emphasizing contemporary topics, including opioid education beyond fundamental guidelines. Virtual AD had the additional benefit of expanding geographic reach and flexible scheduling with providers. Conclusions: AD groups across North America have shifted to virtual outreach and delivery strategies. This trend toward virtual AD may aid outreach to vulnerable rural communities, improving health equity. More research is needed on the effectiveness of virtual AD and its future implications.

N2  - Introduction: This article explores the establishment and subsequent challenges faced by a Mother Support Group (MSG) initiated in Gujarat, India, focusing on promoting Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and exclusive breastfeeding, particularly amid the COVID-19 era. Methods: The methodology involved adapting to COVID-19 restrictions, utilizing online platforms for training and webinars, and collaborating with ASHA workers for community outreach. The MSG members received training on breastfeeding and KMC, followed by practical demonstrations and community visits. Although initial efforts were promising, the group’s sustainability faltered when key stakeholders withdrew, revealing challenges in maintaining community-driven interventions. Results and discussion: The article underscores the importance of sustained efforts in establishing and retaining parent support groups. The lack of comprehensive data collection limits the ability to evaluate specific outcomes, but we highlight the potential benefits of MSG, including improved breastfeeding practices and KMC adherence. We acknowledge the need for robust frameworks and standard operating procedures to enhance the sustainability of such initiatives, emphasizing the importance of community involvement and leadership in supporting disadvantaged newborns. Conclusion: We draw attention to the complexities of sustaining grassroots initiatives and call for further research to develop effective models that address the unique needs of marginalized communities, particularly regarding the care of preterm newborns.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk of severe disease progression. Comorbidities, such as chronic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, advanced maternal age and high body mass index, may predispose to severe disease. The management of pregnant COVID-19 patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) is challenging and requires careful consideration of maternal, fetal and ethical issues. Objective: Description and discussion of intensive care treatment strategies and perinatal anesthesiological management in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS). Material and methods: We analyzed the demographic data, maternal medical history, clinical intensive care management, complications, indications and management of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and infant survival of all pregnant patients treated for severe CARDS in the anesthesiological ICU of a German university hospital between March and November 2021. Results: The cohort included 9 patients with a mean age of 30.3 years (range 26–40 years). The gestational age ranged from 21+ 3 weeks to 37+ 2 weeks. None of the patients had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV‑2. Of the nine patients seven were immigrants and communication was hampered by inadequate Central European language skills. Of the patients five had a PaO2/FiO2 index <150mmHg despite escalated invasive ventilation (FiO2 >0.9 and a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of 14mbar) and were therefore treated with repeated prolonged prone positioning maneuvers (5–14 prone positions for 16h each, a total of 47 prone positioning treatments) and 2 required treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and venovenous ECMO. The most common complications were bacterial superinfection of the lungs, urinary tract infection and delirium. All the women and five neonates survived. All newborns were delivered by cesarean section, two patients were discharged home with an intact pregnancy and two intrauterine fetal deaths were observed. None of the newborns tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2 at birth. Conclusion: High survival rates are possible in pregnant patients with CARDS. The peripartum management of pregnant women with CARDS requires close interdisciplinary collaboration and should prioritize maternal survival in early pregnancy. In our experience, prolonged prone positioning, an essential evidence-based cornerstone in the treatment of ARDS, can also be safely used in advanced stages of pregnancy. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and ECMO should be considered as life-saving treatment options for carefully selected patients. For cesarean section, neuraxial anesthesia can be safely performed in patients with mild CARDS if well planned but the therapeutic anticoagulation recommended for COVID-19 may increase the risk of bleeding complications, making general anesthesia a more viable alternative, especially in severe disease.

N2  - Background: Responsive teaching (RT) interventions, which enhance developmental outcomes by improving children's engagement behaviors, are traditionally delivered in person. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic complicated this approach. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and acceptance of online RT in children with developmental disabilities and their parents. Methods: This pilot study was conducted in Jinju, South Korea, and enrolled parent-child dyads referred to Gyeong-sang National University Hospital for developmental concerns between April and September 2022. The children underwent a comprehensive developmental evaluation. The parents received a 5-session RT intervention via ZOOM on a mostly weekly basis. The first 2 sessions involved child development and RT lectures, while the others involved coaching on 3 of the 66 RT strategies. Problem behaviors, parent-child interactions, and parenting stress were assessed preversus postintervention using the Korean versions of the Child Behavior Checklist, Maternal/Child Behavior Rating Scale, and Parent Stress Index 4th Edition Short Form, respectively. Acceptability was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Of the 30 recruited parent-child pairs, 23 (76%) completed the intervention and assessments. The children (mean age, 2.66±0.86 years) included 12 with language delays, 7 with autism spectrum disorder, and 4 with global delays. Predominantly mothers (96%) participated. Online RT significantly improved pivotal behaviors—including joint attention (P=0.04), cooperation (P=0.01), and affect (P=0.01)—and reduced overall problem behaviors (P=0.04). Parents reported less parenting stress (P=0.01), improved interactive behaviors with increased responsiveness (P<0.01), and decreased directiveness (P< 0.01). High satisfaction with online RT interventions was also previously reported. Conclusion: These findings suggest that online RT can improve children’s emotional and behavioral outcomes and maternal interaction styles and reduce parenting stress, offering accessible interventions amid challenges such as limited access and pandemics.

N2  - Worldwide, over 2 billion children under the age of 5 experience stunting, wasting, or are underweight. Malnutrition contributes to 45% of all deaths in this age group (approximately 3.1 million deaths) [1]. Poverty, food insecurity, suboptimal feeding practices, climate change, and conflict are all contributing factors. Malnutrition causes significant respiratory problems, including increased risk of respiratory infections, impaired lung function, and increased risk of subsequent adult respiratory disease, including asthma, COPD, and lung cancer. Childhood malnutrition not only has serious consequences for children's health but it also has numerous consequences on wellbeing and educational attainment. Childhood malnutrition is a complex and multifaceted problem. However, by understanding and addressing the underlying causes, and investing in prevention and treatment programs, it is possible to maximize children's health and wellbeing on a global scale. This narrative review will focus on the impact of childhood malnutrition on lung development, the consequent respiratory disease, and what actions can be taken to reduce the burden of malnutrition on lung health.

N2  - The optimal diagnosis strategy for pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) remains complex. This review summarizes PE diagnosis with clinical presentation, decision rules and investigations for acute PE. This review was performed using studies published between January 1, 2010, and September 1, 2023. PE should be considered in ED in patients with chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope or signs of deep veinous thrombosis. Definitive diagnosis of PE relies on thoracic imaging, with the use of chest tomographic pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy. To limit the continuous increased use of chest imaging, the clinical probability should be the first step for PE workup. The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) can rule out PE at this stage. If not, for low or intermediate probability, several clinical decision rules have been validated, either by ruling out PE on clinical signs, or by raising D-dimer thresholds (YEARS or PEGeD [Pulmonary Embolism Graduated D-Dimer] criteria) or by combination of these different rules. It is recommended that patients with a high clinical probability of PE should undergo chest imaging without the need for D-dimer testing. The PE diagnostic approach can be tailored in specific populations such as pregnant, younger, COVID-19, or cancer patients. PE diagnosis workup illustrates the complexity of modern probabilistic-based approaches of decision-making in medicine. It is recommended to use a Bayesian approach with the evaluation of clinical probability, then order D-dimer if the PERC rule is positive, then adapt the D-dimer threshold for ordering chest imaging using clinical decision rules.

N2  - Introduction: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about global uncertainties and fears, escalating the dissemination of fake news. This study aims to analyze the impact of fake news on COVID-19 vaccine adherence among pregnant women, providing crucial insights for effective communication strategies during the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, exploratory study was conducted with 113 pregnant women under care at a Women’s Health Reference Center. Data analysis included relative frequency and odds ratio to assess the relationship between sociodemographic and behavioral variables regarding vaccination. Results: In the behavioral context of vaccination, internet access shows a significant association with decision-making, influencing vaccine refusal due to online information. Nuances in the odds ratios results highlight the complexity of vaccine hesitancy, emphasizing the importance of information quality. Pre-vaccination sentiments include stress (87.61%), fear (50.44%), and anxiety (40.7%), indicating the need for sensitive communication strategies. Discussion: Results revealed that pregnant women with higher education tend to adhere more to vaccination. Exposure to news about vaccine inefficacy had a subtle association with hesitancy, while finding secure sources was negatively associated with hesitancy. The behavioral complexity in the relationship between online information access and vaccination decision underscores the need for effective communication strategies. Conclusions: In the face of this challenging scenario, proactive strategies, such as developing specific campaigns for pregnant women, are essential. These should provide clear information, debunk myths, and address doubts. A user-centered approach, understanding their needs, is crucial. Furthermore, ensuring information quality and promoting secure sources are fundamental measures to strengthen trust in vaccination and enhance long-term public health.

N2  - The post-COVID-19 landscape has propelled the global telemedicine sector to a projected valuation of USD 91.2 billion by 2022, with a remarkable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.6% from 2023 to 2030. This paper introduces an analytical wearable healthcare monitoring device (WHMD) designed for the timely detection and seamless transmission of crucial health vitals to telemedical cloud agents. The fractional order modeling approach is employed to delineate the efficacy of the WHMD in pregnancy-related contexts. The Caputo fractional calculus framework is harnessed to show the device potential in capturing and communicating vital health data to medical experts precisely at the cloud layer. Our formulation establishes the fractional order model's positivity, existence, and uniqueness, substantiating its mathematical validity. The investigation comprises two major equilibrium points: the disease-free equilibrium and the equilibrium accounting for disease presence, both interconnected with the WHMD. The paper explores the impact of integrating the WHMD during pregnancy cycles. Analytical findings show that the basic reproduction number remains below unity, showing the WHMD efficacy in mitigating health complications. Furthermore, the fractional multi-stage differential transform method (FMSDTM) facilitates optimal control scenarios involving WHMD utilisation among pregnant patients. The proposed approach exhibits robustness and conclusively elucidates the dynamic potential of WHMD in supporting maternal health and disease control throughout pregnancy. This paper significantly contributes to the evolving landscape of analytical wearable healthcare research, highlighting the critical role of WHMDs in safeguarding maternal well-being and mitigating disease risks in edge reconfigurable health architectures.

N2  - Introduction: Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) transitioning from jails or prisons to the community are at high risk of overdose-related death shortly after release. Buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone are FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to reduce overdose risk and increase treatment engagement. Despite the evidence, many correctional facilities in the United States do not provide MOUD to their incarcerated population. Albany County Jail and Rehabilitative Services Center (ACCRSC) is a jail in New York State that provides comprehensive MOUD and overdose prevention services to all incarcerated individuals with OUD. Methods: MOUD program participants' data was collected during custody and after release to determine whether the program's primary goals of preventing overdose-related mortality and MOUD continuation after release were met. Other quality-of-life metrics were used for program improvements, such as program participants' physical and mental well-being, postrelease housing, employment, access to mental health services, and re-incarceration. Results: This study included 375 unique individuals who received MOUD treatment at the jail between January 19, 2019, and the end of December 2020, with 56.2 % continuing their treatment and 43.7 % initiating MOUD during custody. Among those who initiated MOUD at ACCRSC, 93.3 % were enrolled in buprenorphine. We identified eight program participant deaths after release within a year after incarceration. The average time between release and death was 233 days, with the shortest time between release and death being 107 days. We found that over half (53.6 %) of program participants using buprenorphine picked up their prescriptions after exiting ACCRSC. Among those who did not, nearly 16 % were unable to do so because they were transferred to another jail or prison that did not provide MOUD care. Overall, nearly 80 % of program participants who were transferred to another correctional facility could not continue their medication. Conclusions: MOUD in correctional settings appears to reduce overdose deaths immediately after release. Administering buprenorphine and other types of MOUD in a jail setting has shown relatively high retention for people to fill their first prescription of buprenorphine outside the jail. To ensure high MOUD retention among incarcerated populations, all correctional facilities must provide MOUD care.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted family and community support systems that typically nurture pregnancy and birth experiences of migrant Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan women in Australia. Very little is known about how COVID-19 lockdown measures impacted Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan pregnant women living in Australia during the pandemic. Using an intersectional and resilience thinking approach, we explored the social and emotional resilience of Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan pregnant women living in Victoria, Australia during COVID-19 lockdowns. Semi-structured photo-elicitation interviews were conducted in English, Tamil and Bangla and audio-recorded in-person and virtually. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the visual and oral qualitative data produced. Twenty-five Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan-born women were interviewed. Three key themes emerged from data analysis: challenges exacerbated by COVID-19, sources of social resilience, and sources of emotional resilience. Participants were negatively impacted by closed international borders, care for children, financial pressures of temporary residence and their physical and mental health was impacted. Primary sources of social resilience were derived from family, community and healthcare professional support. Photo data produced by participants depicted patterns of emotional resilience to overcome the challenges of social isolation during their pregnancy in lockdown. The visual and oral data highlighted that participants were significantly impacted by social isolation during COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia. Findings from this study can contribute to understanding how social support networks influence maternity during a pandemic and how culturally safe maternal health practices can be reinforced to support the motherhood of migrant women regardless of visa status.

N2  - Objective: The present study aimed to understand, relative to standard care, whether continuity of care models (private midwifery, continuity of care with a private doctor, continuity of care with a public midwife), and women's experience of maternity care provision, during the perinatal period buffered the association between prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and infant birth outcomes (gestational age [GA], birth weight [BW] and birth weight for gestational age [BW for GA]). Methods: 2207 women who were pregnant in Australia while COVID-19 restrictions were in place reported on their COVID-19 related objective hardship and subjective distress during pregnancy and provided information on their model of maternity care. Infant birth outcomes (BW, GA) were reported on at 2-months postpartum. Results: Multiple linear regressions showed no relationship between PNMS and infant BW, GA or BW for GA, and neither experienced continuity of care, nor model of maternity care moderated this relationship. However, compared with all other models of care, women enrolled in private midwifery care reported the highest levels of experienced continuity of care and birthed infants at higher GA. BW and BW for GA were higher in private midwifery care, relative to standard care. Conclusion: Enrollment in continuous models of perinatal care may be a better predictor of infant birth outcomes than degree of PNMS exposure. These results highlight the possibility that increased, continuous support to women during pregnancy may play an important role in ensuring positive infant birth outcomes during future pandemics.

N2  - Background Despite the advantages of vaccination in preventing maternal and fetal problems, there were many concerns in the medical community regarding vaccine safety for pregnant women, and this has put obstetricians in a challenging situation when it comes to advising their pregnant patients on whether to obtain the vaccine Aim This study was performed to define the level of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and assess the impact of COVID-19 attitudes and knowledge on vaccine acceptance between pregnant and lactating Syrian women who are seeking prenatal care services at the clinics in Azraq refugee camp in Jordan. Method A quantitative, cross-sectional study utilizing a non-probability convenience sample. A validated and reliable self-administered questionnaire consisting of four sections was used. Results A total of 412 pregnant/lactating women was recruited The acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among participants was 86.5%. There was a significant positive moderate association between respondents’ attitudes and knowledge around the COVID-19 vaccine and their acceptance of the vaccine (r = .468, p < .001, r = .357, p < .001), respectively. Conclusion To effectively mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and achieve collective protection, decision-makers must intensify the efforts in promoting the importance of maternal vaccination, especially in vulnerable communities that suffer the most from pandemic outcomes.

N2  - Despite the known benefits, some individuals remain apprehensive about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, which hampers vaccination efforts and the achievement of herd immunity. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess vaccination rates and identify factors influencing fear of the COVID-19 vaccine among individuals served by the public healthcare system (Family Health Strategy - FHS) and in a university community in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Surveys were conducted face-to-face with FHS participants and online with university members, employing a free sharing approach on social media. A total of 1896 and 312 responses were collected, respectively. The survey covered sociodemographic information, COVID-19 fear levels, and vaccination status for both individuals and their children Vaccination coverage was 83% among FHS participants and 99.1% in the university setting. Female respondents in both groups exhibited higher levels of COVID-19 fear (p<0.05), with FHS-assisted women reporting greater apprehension towards vaccination (p<0.05). Educated parents demonstrated better understanding of the importance of child vaccination, while younger parents expressed heightened concerns about vaccine side effects. Among FHS participants, women exhibited a 1.6 times higher fear of vaccination compared to men. Additionally, fear of vaccination increased by 1.10 times for each additional point on the COVID-19 Fear Scale (physiological domain). Effective communication strategies and dispelling misconceptions surrounding immunization could alleviate fear and promote vaccination acceptance.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated persistent health inequities in perinatal populations, resulting in disparities of maternal and fetal complications. In this narrative review, we present an adapted conceptual framework of perinatal social determinants of health in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and use this framework to contextualize the literature regarding disparities in COVID-19 vaccination and infection. We synthesize how elements of the structural context, individual socioeconomic position, and concrete intermediary determinants influence each other and perinatal COVID-19 vaccination and infection, arguing that systemic inequities at each level contribute to observed disparities in perinatal health outcomes. From there, we identify gaps in the literature, propose mechanisms for observed disparities, and conclude with a discussion of strategies to mitigate them.

N2  - Viral infections during pregnancy are associated with significant adverse perinatal and fetal outcomes. Pregnancy is a unique immunologic and physiologic state, which can influence control of virus replication, severity of disease, and vertical transmission. The placenta is the organ of the maternal-fetal interface and provides defense against microbial infection while supporting the semi-allogeneic fetus via tolerogenic immune responses. Some viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and rubella virus, can breach these defenses, directly infecting the fetus and having long-lasting consequences. Even without direct placental infection, other viruses, including respiratory viruses like influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, still cause placental damage and inflammation. Concentrations of progesterone and estrogens rise during pregnancy and contribute to immunological adaptations, placentation, and placental development and play a pivotal role in creating a tolerogenic environment at the maternal-fetal interface. Animal models, including mice, nonhuman primates, rabbits, and guinea pigs, are instrumental for mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections during pregnancy and identification of targetable treatments to improve health outcomes of pregnant individuals and offspring.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Identifying effective opioid treatment options during pregnancy is a high priority due to the growing prevalence of opioid use disorder across North America. We assessed the temporal impact of three population-level interventions on the use of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) during pregnancy in Ontario, Canada. DESIGN: This was a population-based time-series analysis to identify trends in the monthly prevalence of pregnant people dispensed methadone and buprenorphine. The impact of adding buprenorphine/naloxone to the public drug formulary, the release of pregnancy-specific guidance and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Ontario, Canada between 1 July 2013 and 31 March 2022, comprising people who delivered a live or stillbirth in any Ontario hospital during the study period. MEASUREMENTS: We identified any prescription for methadone or buprenorphine dispensed between the estimated conception date and delivery date and calculated the monthly prevalence of OAT-exposed pregnancies among all pregnant people in Ontario. FINDINGS: Overall, rates of OAT during pregnancy have declined since mid-2018. Methadone-exposed pregnancies decreased from 0.46% of all pregnancies in Ontario in 2015 to a low of 0.16% in 2022. In the primary analysis, none of the interventions had a statistically significant impact on overall OAT rates; however, in the stratified analyses, there was a small increase in buprenorphine after the formulary change [0.006%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.0032-0.0081, P < 0.0001] and a decrease in buprenorphine after the release of the 2017 guidelines (-0.005%, 95% CI = -0.0080 to -0.0020, P = 0.001) and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (-0.003%, 95% CI = -0.0054 to -0.0006, P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Despite changes in guidance and funding, opioid agonist treatment during pregnancy has been declining in Ontario, Canada since 2018.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experiences of women with kidney disease, residing in the United Kingdom (UK), living through the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic with specific focus on preconception decision-making, family planning, and parenting. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study, comprising an online survey and follow-up interviews, with UK-resident women aged 18-50. RESULTS: We received 431 surveys and conducted 30 interviews. Half (n = 221, 51%) of the survey respondents considered that COVID-19 influenced the quality of communication with healthcare professionals and 68% (n = 295) felt that the pandemic disrupted their support networks. Interview participants indicated that delayed and canceled appointments caused anxiety, grief, and loss of pregnancy options. Women's perception of themselves as (good) mothers as well as their capacity to have and raise a child, meet partners, and sustain healthy relationships was negatively affected by the "clinically extremely vulnerable" label. Women's trust in their healthcare was dismantled by miscommunication and variation in lockdown rules that caused confusion and increased worry. Women reported that COVID-19 contributed to postnatal depression, excessive concern over infant mortality, preoccupation over others following rules, and catastrophising. CONCLUSION: Some women in the UK with chronic kidney disease lost or missed their opportunity to have children during the pandemic. Future pandemic planners need to look more holistically and longer term at what is and is not classed as an emergency, both in how services are reconfigured and how people with chronic conditions are identified, communicated with, and treated.

N2  - CONTEXT: The United States' response to COVID-19 created a policy, economic, and healthcare provision environment that had implications for the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of racialized and minoritized communities. Perspectives from heterogenous immigrant communities in New York City, the pandemic epicenter in the United States (US), provides a glimpse into how restrictive social policy environments shape contraception, abortion, pregnancy preferences, and other aspects of SRH for marginalized immigrant communities. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews in 2020 and 2021 with 44 cisgender immigrant women from different national origins and 19 direct service providers for immigrant communities in New York City to explore how immigrants were forced to adapt their SRH preferences and behaviors to the structural barriers of the COVID-19 pandemic. We coded and analyzed the interviews using a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: Pandemic-related fears and structural barriers to healthcare access shaped shifts in contraceptive use and preferences among our participants. Immigrant women weighed their concerns for health and safety and the potential of facing discrimination as part of their contraceptive preferences. Immigrants also described shifts in their pregnancy preferences as rooted in concerns for their health and safety and economic constraints unique to immigrant communities. CONCLUSION: Understanding how immigrant women's SRH shifted in response to the structural and policy constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic can reveal how historically marginalized communities will be impacted by an increasingly restrictive reproductive health and immigration policy landscape.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore antenatal experiences of social and healthcare professional support during different phases of social distancing restriction implementation in the UK. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted via telephone or video-conferencing software between 13 July 2020 - 2 September 2020. Interviews were transcribed and a recurrent, cross-sectional, thematic analysis was conducted. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve antenatal women were interviewed during UK social distancing restrictions (Timepoint 1; T1) and a separate sample of twelve women were interviewed in the initial easing of these restrictions (Timepoint 2; T2). FINDINGS: T1 themes were: 'Maternity care as non-essential' and 'Pregnancy is cancelled'. T2 themes were: 'Technology is a polarised tool' and 'Clinically vulnerable, or not clinically vulnerable? That is the question'. KEY CONCLUSIONS: At T1, anxieties were ascribed to the exclusion of partners from routine care, and to perceived insensitivity and aggression from the public. For T2, insufficient Governmental transparency led to disillusionment, confusion, and anger. Covert workplace discrimination also caused distress at T2. Across timepoints: deteriorated mental wellbeing was attributed to depleted opportunities to interact socially and scaled back maternity care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Recommendations are made to: protect maternal autonomy; improve quality of mental health and routine care signposting; prioritise parental community support in the re-opening of 'non-essential' services; prioritise the option for face-to-face appointments when safe and legal; and protecting the rights of working mothers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between symptoms of postpartum depression and the number of remote visitations among mothers of infants in the NICU. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NICU in a medical university in Iwate, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 89 mothers of infants who spent more than 1 month in the NICU from June 2021 to December 2022. METHODS: Participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4 days and 1 month after birth. We used a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer or Games-Howell post hoc tests to examine differences in postpartum depression among three groups based on the frequency of remote visitation: frequent visitation, rare visitation, or no visitation. RESULTS: Of the 89 mothers, 41 scored 9 points or higher on the EPDS conducted 4 days after birth; among them, 14 did not visit, 13 rarely visited, and 14 frequently visited the NICU remotely through a web camera. The rare visitation group had significantly higher EPDS scores 1 month after birth (M = 9.7, SD = 5.2) than the frequent (M = 5.3, SD = 3.7) and no visitation (M = 5.1, SD = 4.2) groups (p < .05). The rare visitation group demonstrated lower improvement on the EPDS than the frequent and no visitation groups (nonsignificant). CONCLUSION: It is unclear whether remote visitation reduces symptoms of postpartum depression; however, the frequency of remote visitation could be assessed to identify at-risk mothers in need of social support.

N2  - The involvement of the Signal peptide-complement components of C1r/C1s, the sea urchin Uegf and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (CUB) domain-Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-related (SCUBE) gene in human diseases has been progressively apparent. The SCUBE1 is detectable in platelet-aggregation diseases. The SCUBE2 is reported to have a better cancer survival prognosis. However, SCUBE3 is detected in bone-related diseases. SCUBE gene interacts with Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which has a wide range of biological functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and activation of platelet activity. The current review is a systematic review performed using SCOPUS, Cochrane, and Pubmed/Medline according to The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines. This review discusses the entanglement of the SCUBE gene’s potential role in human diseases. Examining the role of the SCUBE family sheds new light on platelet aggregation-related diseases, cancer prognosis, and their pathogenesis.

N2  - Background This service evaluation describes the rapid implementation of self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) into maternity care at a tertiary referral centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. It summarises findings, identifies knowledge gaps and provides recommendations for further research and practice. Intervention Pregnant and postpartum women monitored their blood pressure (BP) at home, with instructions on actions to take if their BP exceeded pre-determined thresholds. Some also conducted proteinuria self-testing. Data collection and analysis Maternity records, app data and staff feedback were used in interim evaluations to assess process effectiveness and guide adjustments, employing a Plan-Do-Study-Act and root cause analysis approach. Results Between March 2020 and August 2021, a total of 605 women agreed to self-monitor their BP, including 10 women with limited English. 491 registered for telemonitoring (81.2%). 21 (3.5%) took part in urine self-testing. Engagement was high and increased over time with no safety issues. Biggest concerns related to monitor supply and postnatal monitoring. In December 2020, SMBP was integrated into the standard maternity care pathway. Conclusions This project demonstrated successful integration of SMBP into maternity care. Early stakeholder engagement and clear guidance were crucial and community midwifery support essential. Supplying BP monitors throughout pregnancy and post partum could improve the service and fully digitised maternity records would aid data collection. More research is needed on SMBP in the postnatal period and among non-English speakers. These findings support efforts to implement app-supported self-monitoring and guide future research.

N2  - Objective COVID-19 infection may produce severe pneumonia, mainly in the adult population. Pregnant women with severe pneumonia are at high risk of developing complications, and conventional therapy sometimes fails to reverse hypoxemia. Therefore, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an option in cases with refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. This study aims to evaluate the maternal-fetal risk factors, clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of 11 pregnant or peripartum patients with COVID-19 treated with ECMO. Study Design This is a retrospective descriptive study of 11 pregnant women undergoing ECMO therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results In our cohort, four patients underwent ECMO during pregnancy (36.3%) and 7 during the postpartum period. Initially, they started on venovenous ECMO, and three patients were required to change modality due to clinical conditions. In total, 4/11 pregnant women (36.3%) died. We established two periods that differed in the implementation of a standardized care model for reducing associated morbidities and mortality. Neurological complications were responsible for most deaths. Regarding fetal outcomes at early-stage pregnancies on ECMO (4), we report three stillbirths (75%), and one newborn (twin pregnancy) survived and had a favorable evolution. Conclusion At later-stage pregnancies, all newborns survived, and we did not identify any vertical infection. ECMO therapy is an alternative for pregnant women with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, and may improve maternal and neonatal results. Regarding fetal outcomes, the gestational age played a definitive role. However, the main complications reported in our series and others are neurological. It is essential to develop novel, future interventions to prevent these complications.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Curcumin is a polyphenol with a variety of pharmacological actions. Despite its therapeutic effects and well-known safety profile, the utility of curcumin has been limited due to its deprived physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic profile resulting from limited solubility, durability, prompt deterioration and pitiable systemic availability. Employment of an amalgamated framework integrating the potential advantages of a nanoscaffold alongside the beneficial traits of inhalational drug delivery system beautifully bringing down the restricting attributes of intended curative interventions and further assures its clinical success. AREAS COVERED: Current review discussed different application of inhalable nanocurcumin in different medical conditions. Lung diseases have been the prime field in which inhalable nanocurcumin had resulted in significant beneficial effects.

N2  - Background: Detailed, comprehensive, and timely reporting on population health by underlying causes of disability and premature death is crucial to understanding and responding to complex patterns of disease and injury burden over time and across age groups, sexes, and locations. The availability of disease burden estimates can promote evidence-based interventions that enable public health researchers, policy makers, and other professionals to implement strategies that can mitigate diseases. It can also facilitate more rigorous monitoring of progress towards national and international health targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. For three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has filled that need. A global network of collaborators contributed to the production of GBD 2021 by providing, reviewing, and analysing all available data. GBD estimates are updated routinely with additional data and refined analytical methods. GBD 2021 presents, for the first time, estimates of health loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The GBD 2021 disease and injury burden analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and injuries using 100 983 data sources. Data were extracted from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, censuses, household surveys, disease-specific registries, health service contact data, and other sources. YLDs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific prevalence of sequelae by their respective disability weights, for each disease and injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific deaths by the standard life expectancy at the age that death occurred. DALYs were calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. HALE estimates were produced using YLDs per capita and age-specific mortality rates by location, age, sex, year, and cause. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws. Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Counts and age-standardised rates were calculated globally, for seven super-regions, 21 regions, 204 countries and territories (including 21 countries with subnational locations), and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. Here we report data for 2010 to 2021 to highlight trends in disease burden over the past decade and through the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Global DALYs increased from 2·63 billion (95% UI 2·44–2·85) in 2010 to 2·88 billion (2·64–3·15) in 2021 for all causes combined. Much of this increase in the number of DALYs was due to population growth and ageing, as indicated by a decrease in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates of 14·2% (95% UI 10·7–17·3) between 2010 and 2019. Notably, however, this decrease in rates reversed during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates since 2019 of 4·1% (1·8–6·3) in 2020 and 7·2% (4·7–10·0) in 2021. In 2021, COVID-19 was the leading cause of DALYs globally (212·0 million [198·0–234·5] DALYs), followed by ischaemic heart disease (188·3 million [176·7–198·3]), neonatal disorders (186·3 million [162·3–214·9]), and stroke (160·4 million [148·0–171·7]). However, notable health gains were seen among other leading communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Globally between 2010 and 2021, the age-standardised DALY rates for HIV/AIDS decreased by 47·8% (43·3–51·7) and for diarrhoeal diseases decreased by 47·0% (39·9–52·9). Non-communicable diseases contributed 1·73 billion (95% UI 1·54–1·94) DALYs in 2021, with a decrease in age-standardised DALY rates since 2010 of 6·4% (95% UI 3·5–9·5). Between 2010 and 2021, among the 25 leading Level 3 causes, age-standardised DALY rates increased most substantially for anxiety disorders (16·7% [14·0–19·8]), depressive disorders (16·4% [11·9–21·3]), and diabetes (14·0% [10·0–17·4]). Age-standardised DALY rates due to injuries decreased globally by 24·0% (20·7–27·2) between 2010 and 2021, although improvements were not uniform across locations, ages, and sexes. Globally, HALE at birth improved slightly, from 61·3 years (58·6–63·6) in 2010 to 62·2 years (59·4–64·7) in 2021. However, despite this overall increase, HALE decreased by 2·2% (1·6–2·9) between 2019 and 2021. Interpretation: Putting the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of causes of health loss is crucial to understanding its impact and ensuring that health funding and policy address needs at both local and global levels through cost-effective and evidence-based interventions. A global epidemiological transition remains underway. Our findings suggest that prioritising non-communicable disease prevention and treatment policies, as well as strengthening health systems, continues to be crucially important. The progress on reducing the burden of CMNN diseases must not stall; although global trends are improving, the burden of CMNN diseases remains unacceptably high. Evidence-based interventions will help save the lives of young children and mothers and improve the overall health and economic conditions of societies across the world. Governments and multilateral organisations should prioritise pandemic preparedness planning alongside efforts to reduce the burden of diseases and injuries that will strain resources in the coming decades.

N2  - Background: Future trends in disease burden and drivers of health are of great interest to policy makers and the public at large. This information can be used for policy and long-term health investment, planning, and prioritisation. We have expanded and improved upon previous forecasts produced as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) and provide a reference forecast (the most likely future), and alternative scenarios assessing disease burden trajectories if selected sets of risk factors were eliminated from current levels by 2050. Methods: Using forecasts of major drivers of health such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a composite measure of lag-distributed income per capita, mean years of education, and total fertility under 25 years of age) and the full set of risk factor exposures captured by GBD, we provide cause-specific forecasts of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age and sex from 2022 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories, 21 GBD regions, seven super-regions, and the world. All analyses were done at the cause-specific level so that only risk factors deemed causal by the GBD comparative risk assessment influenced future trajectories of mortality for each disease. Cause-specific mortality was modelled using mixed-effects models with SDI and time as the main covariates, and the combined impact of causal risk factors as an offset in the model. At the all-cause mortality level, we captured unexplained variation by modelling residuals with an autoregressive integrated moving average model with drift attenuation. These all-cause forecasts constrained the cause-specific forecasts at successively deeper levels of the GBD cause hierarchy using cascading mortality models, thus ensuring a robust estimate of cause-specific mortality. For non-fatal measures (eg, low back pain), incidence and prevalence were forecasted from mixed-effects models with SDI as the main covariate, and YLDs were computed from the resulting prevalence forecasts and average disability weights from GBD. Alternative future scenarios were constructed by replacing appropriate reference trajectories for risk factors with hypothetical trajectories of gradual elimination of risk factor exposure from current levels to 2050. The scenarios were constructed from various sets of risk factors: environmental risks (Safer Environment scenario), risks associated with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNs; Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination scenario), risks associated with major non-communicable diseases (NCDs; Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario), and the combined effects of these three scenarios. Using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 as reference and SSP1-1.9 as an optimistic alternative in the Safer Environment scenario, we accounted for climate change impact on health by using the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature forecasts and published trajectories of ambient air pollution for the same two scenarios. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were computed using standard methods. The forecasting framework includes computing the age-sex-specific future population for each location and separately for each scenario. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. Findings: In the reference scenario forecast, global and super-regional life expectancy increased from 2022 to 2050, but improvement was at a slower pace than in the three decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning in 2020). Gains in future life expectancy were forecasted to be greatest in super-regions with comparatively low life expectancies (such as sub-Saharan Africa) compared with super-regions with higher life expectancies (such as the high-income super-region), leading to a trend towards convergence in life expectancy across locations between now and 2050. At the super-region level, forecasted healthy life expectancy patterns were similar to those of life expectancies. Forecasts for the reference scenario found that health will improve in the coming decades, with all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreasing in every GBD super-region. The total DALY burden measured in counts, however, will increase in every super-region, largely a function of population ageing and growth. We also forecasted that both DALY counts and age-standardised DALY rates will continue to shift from CMNNs to NCDs, with the most pronounced shifts occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (60·1% [95% UI 56·8–63·1] of DALYs were from CMNNs in 2022 compared with 35·8% [31·0–45·0] in 2050) and south Asia (31·7% [29·2–34·1] to 15·5% [13·7–17·5]). This shift is reflected in the leading global causes of DALYs, with the top four causes in 2050 being ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared with 2022, with ischaemic heart disease, neonatal disorders, stroke, and lower respiratory infections at the top. The global proportion of DALYs due to YLDs likewise increased from 33·8% (27·4–40·3) to 41·1% (33·9–48·1) from 2022 to 2050, demonstrating an important shift in overall disease burden towards morbidity and away from premature death. The largest shift of this kind was forecasted for sub-Saharan Africa, from 20·1% (15·6–25·3) of DALYs due to YLDs in 2022 to 35·6% (26·5–43·0) in 2050. In the assessment of alternative future scenarios, the combined effects of the scenarios (Safer Environment, Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination, and Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenarios) demonstrated an important decrease in the global burden of DALYs in 2050 of 15·4% (13·5–17·5) compared with the reference scenario, with decreases across super-regions ranging from 10·4% (9·7–11·3) in the high-income super-region to 23·9% (20·7–27·3) in north Africa and the Middle East. The Safer Environment scenario had its largest decrease in sub-Saharan Africa (5·2% [3·5–6·8]), the Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario in north Africa and the Middle East (23·2% [20·2–26·5]), and the Improved Nutrition and Vaccination scenario in sub-Saharan Africa (2·0% [–0·6 to 3·6]). Interpretation: Globally, life expectancy and age-standardised disease burden were forecasted to improve between 2022 and 2050, with the majority of the burden continuing to shift from CMNNs to NCDs. That said, continued progress on reducing the CMNN disease burden will be dependent on maintaining investment in and policy emphasis on CMNN disease prevention and treatment. Mostly due to growth and ageing of populations, the number of deaths and DALYs due to all causes combined will generally increase. By constructing alternative future scenarios wherein certain risk exposures are eliminated by 2050, we have shown that opportunities exist to substantially improve health outcomes in the future through concerted efforts to prevent exposure to well established risk factors and to expand access to key health interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic control strategies disrupted the smooth delivery of essential health services (EHS) globally. Limited evidence exists on the health systems lens approach to analyzing the challenges encountered in maintaining EHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to identify the health system challenges encountered and document the mitigation strategies and adaptations made across geopolitical zones (GPZs) in Nigeria. METHODS: The national qualitative survey of key actors across the six GPZs in Nigeria involved ten states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) which were selected based on resilience, COVID-19 burden and security considerations. A pre-tested key informant guide was used to collect data on service utilization, changes in service utilization, reasons for changes in primary health centres' (PHCs) service volumes, challenges experienced by health facilities in maintaining EHS, mitigation strategies implemented and adaptations to service delivery. Emerging sub-themes were categorized under the appropriate pillars of the health system. RESULTS: A total of 22 respondents were interviewed. The challenges experienced in maintaining EHS cut across the pillars of the health systems including: Human resources shortage, shortages in the supply of personal protective equipments, fear of contracting COVID-19 among health workers misconception, ignorance, socio-cultural issues, lockdown/transportation and lack of equipment/waiting area (. The mitigation strategies included improved political will to fund health service projects, leading to improved accessibility, affordability, and supply of consumables. The health workforce was motivated by employing, redeploying, training, and incentivizing. Service delivery was reorganized by rescheduling appointments and prioritizing some EHS such as maternal and childcare. Sustainable systems adaptations included IPC and telehealth infrastructure, training and capacity building, virtual meetings and community groups set up for sensitization and engagement. CONCLUSION: The mitigation strategies and adaptations implemented were important contributors to EHS recovery especially in the high resilience LGAs and have implications for future epidemic preparedness plans.

N2  - Background: The World Health Organization's (WHO) Immunization Agenda 2030 emphasises ensuring equitable access to vaccination across the life course. This includes placing an emphasis on migrant populations who may have missed key childhood vaccines, doses, and boosters due to disrupted healthcare systems and the migration process, or differing vaccination schedules in home countries. Guidelines exist in the UK for offering catch-up vaccinations to adolscent and adult migrants with incomplete or uncertain vaccination status (including MMR, Td-IPV, MenACWY, HPV), but emerging evidence suggests awareness and implementation in primary care is poor. It is unclear whether patient-level barriers to uptake of catch-up vaccinations also exist. We explored experiences and views around catch-up vaccination among adult migrants from a range of backgrounds, to define strategies for improving catch-up vaccination policy and practice. Methods: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out in two phases with adult migrant populations (refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, those with no recourse to public funds) on views and experiences around vaccination, involving a team of peer researchers from specific migrant communities trained through the study. In Phase 1, we conducted remote interviews with migrants resident in the UK for < 10 years, from diverse backgrounds. In Phase 2, we engaged specifically Congolese and Angolan migrants as part of a community-based participatory study. Topic guides were developed iteratively and piloted. Participants were recruited using purposive, opportunistic and snowball sampling methods. Interviews were conducted in English (interpreters offered), Lingala or French and were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework approach in NVivo 12. Results: 71 participants (39 in Phase 1, 32 in Phase 2) were interviewed (Mean age 43.6 [SD:12.4] years, 69% female, mean 9.5 [SD:7] years in the UK). Aside from COVID-19 vaccines, most participants reported never having been offered vaccinations or asked about their vaccination history since arriving in the UK as adults. Few participants mentioned being offered specific catch-up vaccines (e.g. MMR/Td-IPV) when attending a healthcare facility on arrival in the UK. Vaccines such as flu vaccines, pregnancy-related or pre-travel vaccination were more commonly mentioned. In general, participants were not aware of adult catch-up vaccination but regarded it positively when it was explained. A few participants expressed concerns about side-effects, risks/inconveniences associated with access (e.g. links to immigration authorities, travel costs), preference for natural remedies, and hesitancy to engage in further vaccination campaigns due to the intensity of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Trust was a major factor in vaccination decisions, with distinctions noted within and between groups; some held a healthcare professional's recommendation in high regard, while others were less trusting towards the healthcare system because of negative experiences of the NHS and past experiences of discrimination, injustice and marginalisation by wider authorities. Conclusions: The major barrier to adult catch-up vaccination for missed routine immunisations and doses in migrant communities in the UK is the limited opportunities, recommendations or tailored vaccination information presented to migrants by health services. This could be improved with financial incentives for provision of catch-up vaccination in UK primary care, alongside training of healthcare professionals to support catch-up immunisation and raise awareness of existing guidelines. It will also be essential to address root causes of mistrust around vaccination, where it exists among migrants, by working closely with communities to understand their needs and meaningfully involving migrant populations in co-producing tailored information campaigns and culturally relevant interventions to improve coverage.

N2  - Objective This qualitative study explores therapists' and participants' preferences for delivery methods (face-to-face and phone sessions) of a cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychosocial intervention for prenatal anxiety delivered in a tertiary care hospital. Setting The research was conducted in a randomized controlled trial in Pakistan, where a shift from face-to-face to phone-based therapy occurred during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Participants Twenty in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion were conducted with participants and therapists, respectively. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Participants generally preferred face-to-face sessions for rapport building, communication, and comprehension. However, barriers like venue accessibility, childcare, and lack of family support hindered engagement. Telephone sessions were favored for easy scheduling and the comfort of receiving the session at home, but there were challenges associated with phone use, distractions at home, and family members' limited mental health awareness. A mix of face-to-face and telephone sessions was preferred, with rapport from in-person sessions carrying over to telephone interactions. Conclusion This study underscores the need for adaptable intervention delivery strategies that consider cultural norms, logistical challenges, and individual family dynamics. By combining the benefits of both delivery methods, mental health interventions can be optimized to effectively address prenatal anxiety and promote well-being in resource-constrained settings like Pakistan.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Student midwives deliver care for women under challenging job demands, which may affect their mental health- thus creating a high need for health promotion. Given the lack of research addressing this topic, the aim of this study is to examine the links between stress perception, coping behaviors, work-privacy conflict, and perception of COVID-19 pandemic impact on studies of student midwives in northern Germany. METHODS: Data were collected using a cross-sectional online-survey at nine midwifery study sites in northern Germany from October 2022 to January 2023. 342 student midwives (response rate: 61.3%) were surveyed on stress perception, coping behaviors, work-privacy conflict, and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their studies. Descriptive, linear regression and moderation analyses were run to test explorative assumptions. RESULTS: Results revealed that higher levels of perceived stress were reported by 13.4% of student midwives. Social support (M = 13.76, SD = 2.19) and active stress coping (M = 10.72, SD = 2.01) were identified as most prevalent coping behaviors in the present sample. It was found that work-privacy conflict was positively associated with stress perception (ß = 0.53, p =.001) and maladaptive coping behaviors (alcohol and cigarette consumption: ß = 0.14, p =.015), and negatively associated with adaptive coping behaviors (positive thinking: ß = - 0.25, p =.001, social support: ß = - 0.23, p =.001). Students with children reported significantly lower levels of social support than students without children. 55.6% of student midwives perceived a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their studies (mostly on lectures, seminars, and contact with fellow students). CONCLUSIONS: Key findings highlighted moderate stress levels among student midwives during theoretical study stage. Based on current research, prevalence of high stress levels among student midwives remains unclear. Given the overall heterogeneous, limited research on student midwives' stress perception, coping behaviors, work-privacy conflict and perceptions of COVID-19 pandemic impact on studies, implications for research are suggested, e.g. longitudinal studies at different time points and settings and interventional studies. Findings provide a starting point for implementation of workplace health promotion in theoretical and practical stages of midwifery science study programs, e.g. training courses on stress prevention and adaptive coping, and for improvement of working conditions.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the experiences of pregnant Hispanic/Latine people with COVID-19, as well as their perspectives on COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. METHODS: We interviewed birthing parents who received care from a teaching hospital in California and tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or delivery. We analyzed transcripts using the constant comparative method for analyzing data to using a phenomological epidemiological approach. We used root cause analysis to identify consistent themes across interviews and assess relationships between social determinants of health and COVID-19 infectivity. RESULTS: We interviewed 14 women from November 2021 to June 2022. Participants reported COVID-19 adversely impacted their clinical care and well-being during pregnancy or postpartum. Impacts among Spanish-speaking participants included unexpected financial hardships, challenges navigating in-patient experiences, and difficulty securing reliable childcare. While most participants were at least partially vaccinated, participants also described doubts and concerns about the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latine patients could benefit from receiving more information about COVID-19 in pregnancy from their healthcare providers. Leveraging familial and social networks, providing reliable information in people's preferred language, and increasing communication through trusted partners may also help combat vaccine hesitancy.

N2  - Physical inactivity is a leading contributor to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Almost 500 million new cases of preventable noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) will occur globally between 2020 and 2030 due to physical inactivity, costing just over US$300 billion, or around US$ 27 billion annually (WHO 2022). Active adults can achieve a reduction of up to 35% in risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Physical activity also helps in moderating cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, unhealthy weight and type 2 diabetes. For people with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and many cancers, physical activity is an established and evidence-based part of treatment and management. For children and young people, physical activity affords important health benefits. Physical activity can also achieve important cross-sector goals. Increased walking and cycling can reduce journeys by vehicles, air pollution, and traffic congestion and contribute to increased safety and liveability in cities.

N2  - Objective: To determine the impact of implementing emergency care pathway(s) for screening, diagnosing and managing women with gestational diabetes (GDM) during COVID-19. Design: Retrospective multicentre cohort. Setting: Nine National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Trusts/Health boards in England and Scotland. Population: 4915 women with GDM pre-pandemic (1 April 2018 to 31 March 2020), and 3467 women with GDM during the pandemic (1 May 2020 to 31 March 2021). Methods: We examined clinical outcomes for women with GDM prior to and during the pandemic following changes in screening methods, diagnostic testing, glucose thresholds and introduction of virtual care for monitoring of antenatal glycaemia. Main Outcome Measures: Intervention at birth, perinatal mortality, large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal unit admission. Results: The new diagnostic criteria more often identified GDM women who were multiparous, had higher body mass index (BMI) and greater deprivation, and less frequently had previous GDM (all p < 0.05). During COVID, these women had no differences in the key outcome measures. Of the women, 3% were identified with pre-existing diabetes at antenatal booking. Where OGTT continued during COVID, but virtual care was introduced, outcomes were also similar pre- and during the pandemic. Conclusions: Using HbA1c and fasting glucose identified a higher risk GDM population during the pandemic but this had minimal impact on pregnancy outcomes. The high prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes suggests that women with GDM risk factors should be offered HbA1c screening in early pregnancy.

N2  - Pregnant individuals and parents have experienced elevated mental health problems and stress during COVID-19. Stress during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetus and detrimental to the parent–child relationship. However, social support is known to act as a protective factor, buffering against the adverse effects of stress. The present study examined whether (1) prenatal stress during COVID-19 was associated with parent–infant closeness at 6 months postpartum, and (2) social support moderated the effect of prenatal stress on the parent–infant relationship. In total, 181 participants completed questionnaires during pregnancy and at 6 months postpartum. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to assess whether social support moderated the effect of stress during pregnancy on parent–infant closeness at 6 months postpartum. Results indicated a significant interaction between prenatal stress and social support on parents’ perceptions of closeness with their infants at 6 months postpartum (β =.805, p =.029); parents who experienced high prenatal stress with high social support reported greater parent–infant closeness, compared to those who reported high levels of stress and low social support. Findings underscore the importance of social support in protecting the parent–infant relationship, particularly in times of high stress, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - For pregnant women, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented stressors, including uncertainty regarding prenatal care and the long-term consequences of perinatal infection. However, few studies have examined the role of this adverse event on maternal wellbeing and infant socioemotional development following the initial wave of the pandemic when less stringent public health restrictions were in place. The current study addressed these gaps in the literature by first comparing prenatal internalizing symptoms and infant temperament collected after the first wave of the pandemic to equivalent measures in a pre-pandemic sample. Second, associations between prenatal pandemic-related stress and infant temperament were examined. Women who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic endorsed higher pregnancy-specific anxiety relative to the pre-pandemic sample. They also reported greater infant negative emotionality and lower positive affectivity and regulatory capacity at 2 months postpartum. Prenatal infection stress directly predicted infant negative affect. Both prenatal infection and preparedness stress were indirectly related to infant negative emotionality through depression symptoms during pregnancy and at 2 months postpartum. These results have implications for prenatal mental health screening procedures during the pandemic and the development of early intervention programs for infants born to mothers during this adverse event.

N2  - Background: In the general population, maternal COVID-19 is associated with worse maternal and fetal outcomes. Two previous studies have assessed COVID-19 clinical outcomes in pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS), but there are no data about maternal and fetal outcomes. Objectives: In this multicenter study, we aimed to assess maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with MS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We recruited pregnant patients with MS who contracted COVID-19 and were followed up in Italian and Turkish Centers, during 2020–2022. A control group was extracted from a previous Italian cohort. Associations between group (COVID-19 or healthy patients) and clinical outcomes (maternal complications, fetal malformations, and spontaneous abortion) were investigated with a weighted logistic regression where propensity score–based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach was applied for adjusting for difference in baseline confounders. Results: In the multivariable analysis, COVID-19 during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of maternal complications (odd ratio (OR) = 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32–3.48; p = 0.002), while it was not associated with higher risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal malformations. Conclusion: Our data indicate that COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal complications, while it seems to have no significant impact on fetal outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Follow-up study to evaluate perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination and booster with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and Omicron surge in women considering or undergoing fertility treatment. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional anonymous survey (N = 2558) from a single academic fertility center. Five hundred forty patients completed the survey (response rate = 21.1%). Participants were randomized 1:1 to a one-page evidence-based graphic with information and benefits regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Mental health and vaccine hesitancy were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales, and the Medical Mistrust Index (MMI). Results: Majority of participants were nulliparous, fully vaccinated with a booster dose, with > 1 year of infertility and mild to moderate distress. Patients with vaccine hesitancy had higher medical mistrust scores (r =.21, p <.001). Higher MMI scores were not associated with vaccination during pregnancy. Participants that had higher PHQ-8 and GAD-7 scores were more likely to believe the omicron variant would cause delay in fertility treatments, would have impact on fertility outcome, and were more likely exhibiting medical system distrust (p <.001). Participants who received educational material were more likely to know pregnant women with COVID-19 had increased risk of death, stillbirth, and preterm birth (p <.05). Conclusion: The majority of women in this study were vaccinated and had received their booster dose but also with clinically significant levels of depression. Patients with higher levels of distress and greatest medical mistrust demonstrated a concern that the Omicron variant would delay treatment, lead to suboptimal fertility outcomes, and COVID-19 vaccination would impact risk of miscarriages.

N2  - Three-dimensional (3D) human tissue models/microphysiological systems (e.g., organs-on-chips, organoids, and tissue explants) model HIV and related comorbidities and have potential to address critical questions, including characterization of viral reservoirs, insufficient innate and adaptive immune responses, biomarker discovery and evaluation, medical complexity with comorbidities (e.g., tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2), and protection and transmission during pregnancy and birth. Composed of multiple primary or stem cell-derived cell types organized in a dedicated 3D space, these systems hold unique promise for better reproducing human physiology, advancing therapeutic development, and bridging the human–animal model translational gap. Here, we discuss the promises and achievements with 3D human tissue models in HIV and comorbidity research, along with remaining barriers with respect to cell biology, virology, immunology, and regulatory issues.

N2  - With 54 new drugs and seven cellular and gene therapy products, the approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recovered 2023 from the 2022 dent back to the levels of 2020–2021. As in previous years of this annual review, we assign these new drugs to one of three levels of innovation: first drug against a condition (“first-in-indication”), first drug using a novel molecular mechanism (“first-in-class”), and “next-in-class,” i.e., a drug using an already exploited molecular mechanism. We identify four (7%) “first-in-indication,” 22 (36%) “first-in-class,” and 35 (57%) “next-in-class” drugs. By treatment area, rare diseases (54%) and cancer drugs (23%) were once again the most prevalent (and partly overlapping) therapeutic areas. Other continuing trends were the use of accelerated regulatory approval pathways and the reliance on biopharmaceuticals (biologics). 2023 marks the approval of a first therapy based on CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.

N2  - Aim and background:Pandemics are known to have effects on the mental health of the populace. Studies on the effect of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) on the general population have brought out the psychological effects of the pandemic. However, the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on pregnant and postnatal women has not been assessed. The study aimed was to assess the level of psychosocial stress in postnatal and antenatal women during the pandemic and its association of various sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors with high fear of COVID-19 scores. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study included antenatal and post-natal women attending the outpatient clinic. Patients were given questionnaires to document the sociodemographic details, pregnancy-related fear during a pandemic, and fear of COVID-19 scale. Results: A total of 648 women participated in the study. Among the stressors assessed, better support from the partner (n = 623), satisfactory interaction with healthcare workers (n = 627), and lower social deprivation (n = 371) was reported; the participants denied domestic abuse (n = 574) or fear of infecting the newborn (n = 482). Positive associations were observed between high fear of COVID-19 scores and sociodemographic factors like low-income status (p = 0.026), domestic abuse during lockdown (p = 0.0034), difficulty in getting together with family and friends (p = 0.0001), and adverse effect on the financial status of the family (p = 0.0008), difficulty in transport to the hospital (p = 0.007) and fear of the newborn getting affected (p = 0.0002). Conclusion: COVID-19 did not appear to negatively affect the mental health of pregnant and postnatal women or factors assessed in the present study. A high anxiety score was associated with increased anxiety and stress related to COVID-19. Clinical significance: This prospective study provides a basic idea of different risk factors that could affect psychosocial stress in antenatal and postpartum women. The study also emphasizes the importance of support from partners and interactions with healthcare workers to improve the psychosocial status of pregnant and postnatal women.

N2  - Background Congenital toxoplasmosis is a treatable, preventable disease, but untreated causes death, prematurity, loss of sight, cognition and motor function, and substantial costs worldwide. Objectives We asked whether high performance of an Immunochromatographic-test (ICT) could enable accurate, rapid diagnosis/treatment, establishing new, improved care-paradigms at point-of-care and clinical laboratory. Methods Data were obtained in 12 studies/analyses addressing: 1-feasibility/efficacy; 2-false-posi-tives; 3-acceptability; 4-pink/black-line/all studies; 5-time/cost; 6-Quick-Information/Limit-of-detection; 7, 8-acute;-chronic; 9-epidemiology; 10-ADBio; 11,12-Commentary/Cases/ Chronology. Findings ICT was compared with gold-standard or predicate-tests. Overall, ICT performance for 1093 blood/4967 sera was 99.2%/97.5% sensitive and 99.0%/99.7% specific. However, in clinical trial, FDA-cleared-predicate tests initially caused practical, costly problems due to false-positive-IgM results. For 58 persons, 3/43 seronegative and 2/15 chronically infected persons had false positive IgM predicate tests. This caused substantial anxiety, concerns, and required costly, delayed confirmation in reference centers. Absence of false positive ICT results contributes to solutions: Lyon and Paris France and USA Reference laboratories frequently receive sera with erroneously positive local laboratory IgM results impeding patient care. Therefore, thirty-two such sera referred to Lyon’s Reference laboratory were ICT-tested. We collated these with other earlier/ongoing results: 132 of 137 USA or French persons had false-positive local laboratory IgM results identified correctly as negative by ICT. Five false positive ICT results in Tunisia and Marseille, France, emphasize need to confirm positive ICT results with Sabin-Feldman-Dye-test or western blot. Separate studies demonstrated high performance in detecting acute infections, meeting FDA, CLIA, WHO REAS-SURED, CEMark criteria and patient and physician satisfaction with monthly-gestational-ICT-screening. Conclusions/significance This novel paradigm using ICT identifies likely false positives or raises suspicion that a result is truly positive, rapidly needing prompt follow up and treatment. Thus, ICT enables well-accepted gestational screening programs that facilitate rapid treatment saving lives, sight, cognition and motor function. This reduces anxiety, delays, work, and cost at point-of-care and clinical laboratories.

N2  - The mental well-being of men undergoing the transition into fatherhood remains a focal point in public health discourse. In the United Kingdom, fathers encounter limited access to information and support compared to mothers, prompting an exploration of their experiences and the consequential impact on their mental health throughout the stages from pregnancy to post-birth. This study conducted twenty semi-structured interviews with fathers residing in York. Utilizing Zoom, the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. All participants were part of a dual-parent nuclear family unit. The overarching themes of insufficient information and support permeated the findings, with variations in the type of support and information needed and their respective effects on fathers’ mental health evident across the pre-birth, birth and post-birth stages. Throughout these stages, discernible shifts in expectations regarding the perceived role of the father and the ensuing challenges to their mental health were observed. Fathers expressed limited engagement, often cast merely as birth partners, and directed on what to do during birth, with scant acknowledgment of their individual challenges. The constraints imposed by Covid-19 restrictions were reported to intensify the sense of isolation during the transition, exacerbating the impact on fathers’ mental health. The study identifies the diverse challenges fathers encounter at different stages of transitioning into fatherhood and underscores the necessity for tailored access to information and support. While the study is grounded in the experiences of fathers in York, the participants conveyed shared concerns about broader structural and cultural impediments that hinder a meaningful and supportive transition into fatherhood.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought a profound impact on mental health in Sub- Saharan Africa, exacerbating existing disparities and rendering individuals undergoing treatment particularly susceptible. This comprehensive critical review delves into the scope, nature, and extent of COVID-19 impact on mental health services in Sub- Saharan Africa, while concurrently elucidating pivotal lessons and exemplary practices learnt from periods of lockdown. Methods: The methodology was guided by Jesson & Laccy's guide on how to conduct critical literature reviews. Articles were comprehensively sought through two academic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar), complemented by targeted searches on the WHO website and official public health websites of relevant Sub-Saharan African countries. Results: The investigation reveals a surge in mental health challenges, notably marked by a significant escalation in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Disruptions to care services, financial hardships, and the pervasive effects of social isolation further compound this escalation. The pre-existing inequalities in access to and quality of care were accentuated during this crisis, with marginalized groups encountering heightened impediments to essential services. In navigating this unprecedented challenge, communities emerged as integral agents in establishing supportive networks and implementing culturally sensitive interventions. Technology, such as telemedicine and online resources, played a pivotal role in bridging access gaps, particularly in remote areas. The synthesis of best practices for supporting mental health patients during lockdowns encompasses targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, including adolescents and pregnant women. Empowering communities through economic support and mental health literacy programs was identified as crucial. The integration of technology, such as the development of robust telemedicine frameworks, virtual training in curricula, and the utilization of digital platforms for interventions and public messaging, emerged as a cornerstone in addressing access disparities. Community engagement and resilience-building strategies gained prominence, emphasizing the necessity of collaboration between healthcare providers and communities. Promotion of peer support groups, home-based care, and the preservation of traditional healing practices were underscored as essential components. Conclusion: The study underscores the need to adapt and optimize mental health services during emergencies. This entails prioritizing mental health within emergency response frameworks, exploring alternative service delivery methods, and fortifying data collection and research efforts.

N2  - Background: Pelvic organ prolapse is common, causes unpleasant symptoms and negatively affects women’s quality of life. In the UK, most women with pelvic organ prolapse attend clinics for pessary care. Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaginal pessary selfmanagement on prolapse-specific quality of life for women with prolapse compared with clinic-based care; and to assess intervention acceptability and contextual influences on effectiveness, adherence and fidelity. Design: A multicentre, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial with a mixed-methods process evaluation. Participants: Women attending UK NHS outpatient pessary services, aged ≥ 18 years, using a pessary of any type/material (except shelf, Gellhorn or Cube) for at least 2 weeks. Exclusions: women with limited manual dexterity, with cognitive deficit (prohibiting consent or self-management), pregnant or non-English-speaking. Intervention: The self-management intervention involved a 30-minute teaching appointment, an information leaflet, a 2-week follow-up telephone call and a local clinic telephone helpline number. Clinic-based care involved routine appointments determined by centres’ usual practice. Allocation: Remote web-based application; minimisation was by age, pessary user type and centre. Blinding: Participants, those delivering the intervention and researchers were not blinded to group allocation. Outcomes: The patient-reported primary outcome (measured using the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7) was prolapse-specific quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (a specifically developed health Resource Use Questionnaire was used) at 18 months post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures included self-efficacy and complications. Process evaluation data were collected by interview, audio-recording and checklist. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: Three hundred and forty women were randomised (self-management, n = 169; clinic-based care, n = 171). At 18 months post randomisation, 291 questionnaires with valid primary outcome data were available (self-management, n = 139; clinic-based care, n = 152). Baseline economic analysis was based on 264 participants (self-management, n = 125; clinic-based care, n = 139) with valid quality of life and resource use data. Self-management was an acceptable intervention. There was no group difference in prolapse-specific quality of life at 18 months (adjusted mean difference −0.03, 95% confidence interval −9.32 to 9.25). There was fidelity to intervention delivery. Self-management was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, with an estimated incremental net benefit of £564.32 and an 80.81% probability of cost-effectiveness. At 18 months, more pessary complications were reported in the clinic-based care group (adjusted mean difference 3.83, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 6.86). There was no group difference in general self-efficacy, but selfmanaging women were more confident in pessary self-management activities. In both groups, contextual factors impacted on adherence and effectiveness. There were no reported serious unexpected serious adverse reactions. There were 32 serious adverse events (self-management, n = 17; clinic-based care, n = 14), all unrelated to the intervention. Skew in the baseline data for the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7, the influence of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the potential effects of crossover and the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruited sample were possible limitations. Conclusions: Self-management was acceptable and cost-effective, led to fewer complications and did not improve or worsen quality of life for women with prolapse compared with clinic-based care. Future research is needed to develop a quality-of-life measure that is sensitive to the changes women desire from treatment. Study registration: This study is registered as ISRCTN62510577.

N2  - Background: The aim of the study was to determine the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza disease during the COVID-19 pandemic at 2 Austrian urban pediatric centers between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2022. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational 2-center study on RSV- and influenza virus-associated hospitalizations in infants and children up to 18 years at the University Hospital of Graz and the Clinic Donaustadt of Vienna from October 1, 2019 to April 30, 2022. Hospitalization had to be associated with the infectious disease, proven by polymerase chain reaction, including presence of respiratory symptoms. Demographic data including underlying diseases and treatment strategies were compared between centers and diseases, respectively. Results: There were 826 cases in Graz and 379 in Vienna with significant more RSV cases in Graz and more influenza cases in Vienna (RSV: 76% vs. 59%, influenza: 24% vs. 41%; both P < 0.001). One death occurred in Graz due to RSV and another due to influenza in Vienna. Seasonality only slightly differed between centers and severity of diseases was not aggravated when measured by pediatric intensive care unit admission rates, need for supplemental oxygen and respiratory support between first and last seasons. Treatment regimen differed regarding higher use of antibiotics and rates of intravenous fluids in Vienna compared to higher rates of bronchodilators, corticosteroids and nose drops in Graz. Conclusions: We observed higher numbers of hospitalizations due to both viruses after the lockdown but not increased severity of the diseases; and mortality remained extremely low. Preventive measures should be implemented with high priority especially focused on infants with underlying diseases.

N2  - Improving clinician–patient communication can increase uptake of recommended vaccinations during pregnancy. To evaluate adaptations to and pragmatism of the brief Motivational Interviewing for Maternal Immunizations (MI4MI) intervention and to use the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to describe context and implementation outcomes among clinician and staff participants. We incorporated data from study team members, clinicians and staff participants, pregnant patients at participating clinics, and patient medical records. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using surveys, chart reviews, study team notes, interviews, and focus groups. Adaptations were evaluated using the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME) and pragmatism was measured with PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2). MI4MI was effective at improving participants’ vaccine communication experiences. Adoption was limited by our recruitment approach. MI4MI implementation was shaped by contextual factors and associated adaptations related to the COVID pandemic and clinic and participant characteristics. Virtual asynchronous intervention delivery had mixed effects on adoption and implementation that varied across clinics and participants. Participants expressed interest in maintaining the MI4MI intervention moving forward; however, identification of sustainability infrastructure was limited. MI4MI was evaluated to be relatively pragmatic. Contextual factors strongly shaped implementation of MI4MI. Future iterations of MI4MI should include training delivery modes and incentives that accommodate a range of participants across job roles and organizational settings. Future studies including control clinics are needed to measure effectiveness for increasing vaccination and comparing virtual versus hybrid implementation strategies.

N2  - Importance Antenatal care plays a crucial role in safely monitoring and ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the fetus during pregnancy, ultimately leading to the best possible perinatal outcomes. Objective The aim of this study was to review and compare the most recently published guidelines on antenatal care. Evidence Acquisition A descriptive review of guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists regarding antenatal care was conducted. Results There is a consensus among the reviewed guidelines regarding the necessary appointments during the antenatal period, the proper timing for induction of labor, the number and frequency of laboratory examinations for the assessment of mother's well-being, and management strategies for common physiological problems during pregnancy, such as nausea and vomiting, heartburn, pelvic pain, leg cramps, and symptomatic vaginal discharge. In addition, special consideration should be given for mental health issues and timely referral to a specialist, reassurance of complete maternal vaccination, counseling for safe use of medical agents, and advice for cessation of substance, alcohol, and tobacco use during pregnancy. Controversy surrounds clinical evaluation during the antenatal period, particularly when it comes to the routine use of an oral glucose tolerance test and symphysis-fundal height measurement for assessing fetal growth, whereas routine cardiotocography and fetal movement counting are suggested practices only by Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Of note, recommendations on nutritional interventions and supplementation are offered only by Public Health Agency of Canada and World Health Organization, with some minor discrepancies in the optimal dosage. Conclusions Antenatal care remains a critical factor in achieving positive outcomes, but there are variations depending on the socioeconomic status of each country. Therefore, the establishment of consistent international protocols for optimal antenatal care is of utmost importance. This can help provide safe guidance for healthcare providers and, consequently, improve both maternal and fetal outcomes. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After participating in this activity, the learner should be better able to describe appropriate laboratory and clinical assessment plans during the antenatal period; identify common physiological problems of pregnancy and propose appropriate management strategies; and evaluate the recommended supplementation and nutritional interventions during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: In the relentless global battle against the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, accurate prediction of disease severity remains a critical challenge, with profound implications for patient outcomes and healthcare resource allocation. As the virus continues to evolve and pose new threats, the need for reliable prognostic indicators becomes increasingly urgent. Effective identification of patients at high-risk of developing severe illness not only facilitates timely intervention and personalised treatment strategies but also optimises healthcare resource utilisation. In this context, the exploration of novel biomarkers and predictive models holds immense promise for enhancing ones understanding of disease progression and improving clinical decision-making. Aim: To study the association between haematological parameters, including Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR), and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), with Computed Tomography Scan Severity Score (CTSS) in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from March 2021 to July 2022 at Government General Hospital (GGH) Nizamabad, Telangana, India. The study encompassed all three COVID-19 waves, included a sample size of 159 Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients, excluding pregnant women and children under 10 years. Upon admission, CTSS and ratios of NLR, LMR, and PLR were recorded in an MS Excel sheet before any medical intervention and then analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software 22.0. Results: The study comprised 159 patients with a mean age of 50.86±13.89 years (ranging from 16 to 85), predominantly male 90 (56.61%). The highest infection rate 85 (53.45%) was in the 41-60 years age group. The NLR was significantly elevated from a mean value of 4.58 to 11.24 (r value=0.78, p-value=<0.001), and LMR notably reduced from 8.27 to 3.80 (r value=0.67, p-value=0.003) in correlation with the severity as indicated by CTSS. Although PLR values were higher in severe cases, increasing from 173.07 in mild cases to 272.29 in severe cases, there was no significant correlation with CTSS (r-value=-0.78, p-value=0.177). Conclusion: CTSS emerges as a valuable radiological biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity. However, due to its cost and limited availability in grassroots-level hospitals, there is a need for alternative severity prediction models. Present study proposes a predictive model using NLR and LMR biomarkers as alternatives to CTSS for assessing COVID-19 severity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Remotely administered mental health care is becoming increasingly common for treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders; however, there is a dearth of literature overviewing direct comparisons between remote and in-person interventions for treatment of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs). The sudden advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York City forced an abrupt conversion for an intensive day treatment program for new mothers with PMADs, from an on-site to a remote program. METHODS: The current report compares outcomes of 81 women who completed the program in-person to those of 60 women who completed the program remotely. RESULTS: Improvement in depression scores was statistically superior in the remote program, and improvement in mother-infant bonding was statistically equivalent between the on-site and remote programs. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that specialized partial hospitalization treatment for individuals with moderate to severe psychiatric illness can be effectively provided via telehealth, thus offering improved convenience, accessibility, and safety without compromising care. We conclude that remotely administered group psychotherapy is an effective intervention for women with moderate to severe PMADs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Missed infant well-child visits (WCV) result in lost opportunities for critical preventive care. Black infants consistently receive less WCV care than other racial groups. We sought to understand barriers and facilitators to timely infant WCV for Black families in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with caregivers of Medicaid-insured Black children aged 15- to 24-months who attended six or fewer of eight recommended well-child visits within the first 15 months of life. Interviews focused on WCV value, barriers, and facilitators. After developing our initial coding structure through rapid qualitative analysis, we inductively derived the final codebook and themes through line-by-line content analysis. RESULTS: Caregivers attended a mean of 3.53 of eight infant visits. Structural (e.g., transportation) and psychological (e.g., maternal depression) barriers delayed Black infant WCV. Families most frequently valued monitoring development and addressing concerns. Caregivers perceived visits as less urgent when infants seemed healthy or more recently avoided visits due to fears around COVID-19. Long waits and feeling rushed/dismissed were linked to WCV delays; positive provider relationships encouraged WCV attendance. Most caregivers reported reluctance to vaccinate. Vaccine hesitancy contributed to delayed infant WCV. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers described several factors that impacted WCV attendance for Black infants. Persistent structural and psychological barriers are compounded by perceptions that caregiver time is not respected and by notable vaccine hesitancy. To address these barriers, well-care can meet Black families in their communities, better address caregiver wellbeing, more efficiently use caregiver and provider time, and cultivate partnerships with Black caregivers.

N2  - CONTEXT: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, home visiting services for low-income children and families were provided almost entirely in person. Little is known about clients' experience of home visiting provided virtually by video or phone instead of, or in addition to, in-person home visiting. OBJECTIVE: To explore the views of clients in the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Home Visiting Program (HVP) across California during the first 2 years of the pandemic. SETTING: Forty counties in California. PARTICIPANTS: CalWORKs HVP clients, currently enrolled or who left the program in the 6 months prior to each survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clients' ratings of participation in and experiences with the CalWORKs HVP services, as well as unmet needs. RESULTS: We collected 1617 surveys from clients across 3 survey rounds. Pandemic-related restrictions resulted in decreased frequency of home visits and a shift from in person to primarily virtual visits. As in-person home visit frequency decreased, there were significant declines in clients' level of agreement that they learned child development skills (P = .04), received parenting services (P = .015) or activities (P < .001), or received infant and child nutrition services (P = .003). There were no declines in level of agreement that the CalWORKs HVP improved the quality of life of clients and their children. DISCUSSION: Clients consistently rated the CalWORKs HVP as positively contributing to their and their children's well-being, regardless of the shift from in person to virtual visits. Clients' participation in some program components decreased over the evaluation. However, it is unknown if clients received fewer referrals, were hesitant to pursue the referrals, or if fewer services were available. Continued research is needed to evaluate the merits and disadvantages of virtual visits as in-person home visits resume postpandemic.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine whether self-perceived benefits of mental health treatment differed between mothers of babies in the neonatal intensive care unit with and without a positive screen for depression based on their Edinburgh Postnatal Depression score. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Mothers were recruited in person pre-COVID-19 pandemic, and via phone call and online advertisement during the pandemic. Mothers completed a 10-item depression scale and whether they believed they would benefit from mental health treatment. A chi-square test determined the difference in perceived benefit between mothers who screened positively for depression and those who did not. RESULTS: This secondary analysis included 205 mothers, with an average age of 29. Of the 68 mothers who screened positively for depression, 12 believed that would not benefit from mental health intervention. Of the 137 who screened negatively for depression, 18 believed they would benefit from mental health intervention. Mothers who screened negatively for depression were significantly less likely to believe they would benefit from mental health intervention. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Depression screening scales offer guidance on which mothers to flag for follow-up, but neither on how a mother will respond nor how to effectively approach a mother about her mental health. Nurses can improve identification and follow-up of depressed mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit by asking mothers about their perceived need for mental health treatment.

N2  - During the postpartum period, fathers may be at risk of increased stress and loneliness, which may be offset or buffered by the provision of social support. This study aimed to explore fathers' postpartum experiences of loneliness, perceived stress, and social support. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used to inform study design and analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted to collect data from 12 fathers, living in the Republic of Ireland, who had an infant aged 6 months or younger. A grounded theory entitled "support for the supporter," describing fathers' experiences with social support, and loneliness during the postpartum period, was derived. Participants described experiencing increased financial pressure and having difficulty balancing the role of "breadwinner" with fatherhood. Participants described feeling excluded from maternity care and lacked avenues for information within the Irish health care system. Participants linked their experiences of loneliness to the lack of social support in the postpartum period. This study offers a novel insight into Irish fathers' experiences with maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is the first to qualitatively explore paternal postpartum loneliness and provides a good foundation for future research and intervention in this area. Findings suggest that it would be wise to promote social support from other experienced fathers, friends, family, and from partners to reduce paternal postpartum loneliness.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Ninety-seven per cent of Indigenous Peoples live in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). A previous systematic integrative review of articles published between 2000 and 2017 identified numerous barriers for Indigenous women in LMICs in accessing maternal healthcare services. It is timely given the aim of achieving Universal Health Coverage in six years' time, by 2030, to undertake another review. This article updates the previous review exploring the recent available literature on Indigenous women's access to maternal health services in LMICs identifying barriers to services. METHODS: An integrative review of literature published between 2018 and 2023 was undertaken. This review followed a systematic process using Whittemore and Knafl's five-step framework for integrative reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 944 articles were identified from six databases: Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Plus with Full Text and APA PsycArticles (through EBSCOhost). The search was undertaken on 16 January 2023. After screening of the title/abstract and the full text using inclusion and exclusion criteria 26 articles were identified. Critical appraisal resulted in 24 articles being included in the review. Data were extracted using a matrix informed by Penchansky and Thomas's taxonomy, extended by Saurman, which focused on six dimensions of access to health care: affordability, accessibility, availability, accommodation, acceptability and awareness. Ten studies took place in Asia, 10 studies were from the Americas and four studies took place in the African region. Seventeen articles were qualitative, two were quantitative and five were mixed methods. The methods for the integrative review were prespecified in a protocol, registered at Open Science Framework. RESULTS: Barriers identified included affordability; community awareness of services including poor communication between providers and women; the availability of services, with staff often missing from the facilities; poor quality services, which did not consider the cultural and spiritual needs of Indigenous Peoples; an overreliance on the biomedical model; a lack of facilities to enable appropriate maternal care; services that did not accommodate the everyday needs of women, including work and family responsibilities; lack of understanding of Indigenous cultures from health professionals; and evidence of obstetric violence and mistreatment of Indigenous women. CONCLUSION: Barriers to Indigenous women's access to maternal health services are underpinned by the social exclusion and marginalisation of Indigenous Peoples. Empowerment of Indigenous women and communities in LMICs is required as well as initiatives to challenge the stigmatisation and marginalisation that they face. The importance of community involvement in design and interventions that support the political and human rights of Indigenous Peoples are required. Limitations of this review include the possibility of missing articles as it was sometimes unclear from the articles whether a particular group was from an Indigenous community. More research on access to services in the postnatal period is still needed, as well as quality quantitative research. There is also a lack of research on Indigenous groups in North Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa - especially hunter-gatherer groups - as well as the impact of COVID-19 on access to services.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial adverse impact on the physical and mental health of pregnant and postpartum women, thereby increasing the risk of postpartum depression (PPD). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a continuous contactless exercise intervention in reducing the risk of depression during the prenatal and postnatal periods. The study utilized an interactive contactless exercise program consisting of Pilates movement over a 16-week period, with 8 weeks during pregnancy and 8 weeks after childbirth. Metabolic and psychological factors related to postpartum depression, including pain, stress, and stress-response markers, were analyzed. The results showed that the exercise intervention significantly alleviated postpartum depression by improving pain (Oswestry Disability Index: Non-exercise, 11.4 ± 14.8 versus Exercise, - 63.1 ± 18.4, p < .001) and stress factors (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: Non-exercise, 8.8 ± 8.72 versus Exercise, - 37.6 ± 9.13, p < .001; Perceived Stress Scale: Non-exercise, 9.21 ± 9.35 versus Exercise, - 20.7 ± 14.4, p < .001) caused by physical/structural imbalances in postpartum women. Additionally, the intervention improved the metabolic imbalances commonly observed after childbirth, including reductions in triglyceride (Interaction effect, p = .017), insulin (Interaction effect, p = .032), and cortisol levels (Interaction effect, p < .001), which are recognized risk factors for postpartum depression. Taken together, these findings suggest that contactless online exercise interventions can mitigate postpartum depression by addressing metabolic dysregulation that frequently occurs after delivery, especially in situations of social isolation caused by the pandemic.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine and mobile app use, potentially changing our historic model of maternity care. MyChart is a widely adopted mobile app used in health care settings specifically for its role in facilitating communication between health care providers and patients with its messaging function in a secure patient portal. However, previous studies analyzing portal use in obstetric populations have demonstrated significant sociodemographic disparities in portal enrollment and messaging, specifically showing that patients who have a low income and are non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and uninsured are less likely to use patient portals. Objective: The study aimed to estimate changes in patient portal use and intensity in prenatal care before and during the pandemic period and to identify sociodemographic and clinical disparities that continued during the pandemic. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data from our health system's Enterprise Data Warehouse. Records were obtained for the first pregnancy episode of all patients who received antenatal care at 8 academically affiliated practices and delivered at a large urban academic medical center from January 1, 2018, to July 22, 2021, in Chicago, Illinois. All patients were aged 18 years or older and attended ≥3 clinical encounters during pregnancy at the practices that used the EMR portal. Patients were categorized by the number of secure messages sent during pregnancy as nonusers or as infrequent (≤5 messages), moderate (6-14 messages), or frequent (≥15 messages) users. Monthly portal use and intensity rates were computed over 43 months from 2018 to 2021 before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. A logistic regression model was estimated to identify patient sociodemographic and clinical subgroups with the highest portal nonuse. Results: Among 12,380 patients, 2681 (21.7%) never used the portal, and 2680 (21.6%), 3754 (30.3%), and 3265 (26.4%) were infrequent, moderate, and frequent users, respectively. Portal use and intensity increased significantly over the study period, particularly after the pandemic. The number of nonusing patients decreased between 2018 and 2021, from 996 of 3522 (28.3%) in 2018 to only 227 of 1743 (13%) in the first 7 months of 2021. Conversely, the number of patients with 15 or more messages doubled, from 642 of 3522 (18.2%) in 2018 to 654 of 1743 (37.5%) in 2021. The youngest patients, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients, and, particularly, non-English-speaking patients had significantly higher odds of continued nonuse. Patients with preexisting comorbidities, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, diabetes, and a history of mental health conditions were all significantly associated with higher portal use and intensity. Conclusions: Reducing disparities in messaging use will require outreach and assistance to low-use patient groups, including education addressing health literacy and encouraging appropriate and effective use of messaging.

N2  - Background and Objectives: This study aims to assess the health status and factors influencing healthy choices among children and young people in Romania, as well as the efficacy of related health education programs. Through understanding these dynamics, the study seeks to provide insights that can shape targeted interventions, policies, and educational strategies to improve this demographic's overall health and well-being. Materials and Methods: For this study, we performed a literature review of original published papers on the health status, healthy habits, health education, predisposition to making healthy choices in the future, and accessibility to the paediatric health system of Romanian children and young people, as well as the effects of different types of educational interventions on this demographic in Romania. Results: The prevalence of dental caries is high in Romania. In terms of eating habits and nutritional status, a worrying proportion of children are overweight or obese, which can lead to a variety of future physical and psychological problems. In terms of physical activity, few adolescents demonstrate regular fitness practices. Romania presents an increase in alcohol and tobacco consumption among adolescents. The mental health of students has become a pressing public health concern, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of social networks is linked to mental health issues among young people. Romania still has one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases and faces a high incidence of cervical cancer, with a mortality rate three times higher than the EU average. High rates of teenage pregnancies are linked to limited information about sexuality and a lack of access to family planning at a young age. There are large discrepancies in the accessibility of medical services between urban and rural areas. Conclusions: Romania faces significant obstacles to providing high-quality healthcare to children and young people. Improving nutrition, immunisation rates, and access to medical services represent essential areas for enhancing the health of children and young people in Romania.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social, familial, and physiological stressors may put maternal-infant bonding at risk. Therefore, it is plausible that the stressful conditions brought on by COVID-19 could influence maternal-infant bonding. This study aimed to elucidate the contribution of COVID-19-related experience to variance in maternal-infant bonding, beyond that of established risk factors and as moderated by social support. METHODS: This longitudinal, multicenter study examined the relationship of demographic and obstetric variables, social support, postpartum depression, as well as COVID-19-related fear, exposure, and subjective difficulty with mother-infant bonding six months following birth. Participants (N = 246) were women who delivered during the pandemics' strict lockdown period and were recruited 10 weeks after a liveborn delivery and followed up six months later. RESULTS: Relationship between fear of COVID-19 and maternal-infant bonding was moderated by social support: Amongst mothers with high levels of social support, fear of COVID-19 negatively predicted bonding. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that social support, while overall a protective factor for mother-infant bonding, may lose its buffering effect when fear of COVID-19 is high. This relationship was maintained even when early bonding experiences such as forced separation and the risk incurred by postpartum depression were accounted for. Implications for providers are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant global healthcare challenges, particularly impacting the continuity of essential health services in low- and middle-income countries. This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization and provision of essential health services in Armenia. METHODS: We employed a conventional qualitative study design, conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews (n = 17) within public and private primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in Armenia in 2021. Our study participants encompassed physicians providing specialty services in PHC facilities (e.g. endocrinologists, gynecologists/obstetricians, and pediatricians), regular visitors to PHC facilities (e.g. adults with chronic diseases, parents of children), and policymakers. Thematic analysis was conducted, yielding five emergent categories: mobilization and organization of PHC services during COVID-19; PHC visits during COVID-19; worsening of chronic conditions due to the decline in PHC visits; problems with routine childhood vaccinations; and patient-provider communication challenges. RESULTS: The number of in-person visits to PHC facilities declined due to adaptations in service delivery, imposed lockdown measures, and the public's fear of visiting healthcare facilities. Maternal and child health services continued with no major disruptions. PHC providers deliberately limited the number of maternal and child visits to essential antenatal care, newborn screenings, and routine childhood immunizations. Still, children experienced some delays in vaccination administration. The pandemic resulted in a notable reduction in follow-up visits and monitoring of patients with chronic conditions, thereby exacerbating their chronic conditions. Phone calls were the primary method of patient-provider communication during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the delivery and utilization of essential healthcare services at PHC facilities, especially for those with chronic conditions who needed continuous care. Unified national-level guidance and technical capacity are needed to direct the provision of essential services at the PHC level, promote effective health communication, and implement digital platforms for the uninterrupted provision of essential care during public health emergencies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic widely disrupted health services provision, especially during the lockdown period, with females disproportionately affected. Very little is known about alternative healthcare sources used by women when access to conventional health services became challenging. This study examined the experiences of women and adolescent girls regarding access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria and their choices of alternative healthcare sources. METHODS: The study sites were two northern states, two southern states, and the Federal Capital Territory. Qualitative data were obtained through 10 focus group discussion sessions held with married adolescents, unmarried adolescents, and older women of reproductive age. The data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach and with the aid of Atlas ti software. RESULTS: Women reported that access to family planning services was the most affected SRH services during the COVID-19 lockdown. Several barriers to accessing SRH services during COVID-19 lockdown were reported, including restriction of vehicular movement, harassment by law enforcement officers, fear of contracting COVID-19 from health facilities, and fear of undergoing compulsory COVID-19 tests when seeking care in health facilities. In the face of constrained access to SRH services in public sector facilities during the COVID-19 lockdown, women sought care from several alternative sources, mostly locally available and informal services, including medicine vendors, traditional birth attendants, and neighbours with some health experience. Women also widely engaged in self-medication, using both orthodox drugs and non-orthodox preparations like herbs. The lockdown negatively impacted on women's SRH, with increased incidence of sexual- and gender-based violence, unplanned pregnancy resulting from lack of access to contraceptives, and early marriage involving adolescents with unplanned pregnancies. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 negatively impacted access to SRH services and forced women to utilise mostly informal service outlets and home remedies as alternatives to conventional health services. There is a need to ensure the continuity of essential SRH services during future lockdowns occasioned by disease outbreaks. Also, community systems strengthening that ensures effective community-based health services, empowered community resource persons, and health-literate populations are imperative for overcoming barriers to healthcare access during future lockdowns.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has left no one untouched. Resident trainees have been driven to reconsider virtually every component of their daily lives. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) residency training and education. METHODS: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted between 2/2022 and 5/2022. A survey was created and distributed to OBGYN residents. The survey queried the effects of the pandemic on OBGYN residents' procedure skills training and mental health. RESULTS: A total of 95 OBGYN residents across programs affiliated with each American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) district participated in the survey. Among them, just over half (n = 52, 55%) self-identified as under-represented minorities. A significant majority, 80% (n = 81), felt their gynecological training was inadequate, with 70% of fourth-year residents expressing a lack of confidence in their ability to independently practice gynecology after graduation. This lack of confidence among fourth-year residents suggests a notable disparity in readiness for independent gynecological practice, linked to meeting ACGME requirements before completing their residency (p = 0.013). Among the residents who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their mental health (n = 76, 80%), about 40% (n = 31) had contemplated self-harm or knew a colleague who considered or attempted suicide (p < 0.001). This issue was especially pronounced in residents experiencing burnout (n = 44, 46%), as nearly half (n = 19, 43%) reported suicidal thoughts or knew someone in their program who had such thoughts or engaged in self-harm (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Residents expressed concerns about reduced hands-on gynecological training and doubts about their readiness for independent practice post-residency, highlighting the need for enhanced support through mentorship and revised training curriculums. Additionally, despite the availability of mental health resources to address pandemic-induced burnout, their underuse suggests a need for more accessible time for residents to use at their discretion and flexible training schedules that encourage mental health support resource utilization.

N2  - Despite the prevalence of perinatal mental health issues in the United States, gaps in care persist. To address this, perinatal health care settings are asked to focus on patients’ mental health by administering standardized screening and, increasingly, by integrating mental health teams in their clinics. Using in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, I investigated these emerging practices, exploring the experiences of certified nurse-midwives, obstetricians, and mental health clinicians. I found that certified nurse-midwives and obstetricians lack time, resources, and expertise, restricting their ability to address patients’ mental health. Integrated mental health clinicians are constrained by the stratified organization of health care and structural deprioritization of mental health. Redesigning perinatal health care and de-siloing mental health training are necessary to increase clinicians’ effectiveness and to improve perinatal health outcomes.

N2  - Latina women in the US were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of structural racism, including discrimination, reduced care access, and elevated risk for illness and death. Although several US policies were implemented to offset the economic toll of the pandemic, few addressed complex stressors, particularly those among Mexican-descent mothers. This qualitative study with thirty-eight perinatal women and mothers of young children who were of Mexican descent sought to identify pandemic-related stressors and solicit recommendations for addressing them during future large-scale crises. Identified stressors included food access issues, mental health needs, and health and safety concerns. The women’s recommendations revealed feasible and actionable strategies, including increased access to behavioral and health care services and accessible information about food-related resources. The findings highlight the critical need for responsive policies and programs to ensure the well-being of Mexican-descent perinatal women and mothers of young children during large-scale crises.

N2  - Background: Giving the existing formal education through the internet without a planned transition to distance education negatively affected the learning processes of the students. Objectives: The study aims to identify the midwifery students’ changing life conditions and e-learning experiences on the state of their anxiety and hopelessness during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Designed as cross-sectional research, the study was performed with the participation of 1,296 midwifery undergraduate students. The survey form comprised of questions that explored the students’ demographic characteristics, life conditions changing during the Covid-19 pandemic and distance education experiences, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale were used in the data collection. Findings: It was discerned that, of the participant midwifery students, 55.2% spent the period of the pandemic in the province center, 51.7% used smartphones to have access to the distance education, 50.3% had trouble in following up the courses due to the limited computer and internet access, 63.5% failed to follow up the courses because of the infrastructure problems related to the distance education. It was found that, of the participant midwifery students, 54.6% exhibited anxiety symptoms and 26.3% had hopelessness symptoms. It was identified that having trouble in following up the courses increased anxiety by 1.438 times (CI:1.103-1.875) and hopelessness by 1.980 times (CI:1.459-2.687), having tensions in the family relations increased anxiety by 2.362 times (CI:1.780-3.134) and hopelessness by 1.789 times (CI:1.235-2.594), and having psychological support for anxiety and worry increased anxiety by 2.914 times (CI:2.208-3.8477) and hopelessness by 1.875 times (CI:1.083-3.247). It was ascertained that hopelessness increased anxiety by 2.878 times (CI:2.075-3.991) whilst anxiety increased hopelessness by 2.755 times (CI:1.985-3.823) (p<0.05). Conclusion: As well as the Covid-19 pandemic, health, social life, and economic changes; the digital separation that accompanies distance education also affects the students’ mental health. Solving the technical problems experienced in distance education, facilitating the follow-up of the courses, and equipping the midwifery students with problem-solving and coping skills will be useful for reducing the midwifery students’ hopelessness and anxiety levels.

N2  - Listening to What Matters is an exploratory descriptive qualitative study that aimed to (1) understand how women of refugee background in Melbourne, Australia experienced access to health information and maternity and/or early parenting care during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) whether pandemic health directives had an impact on structural inequities for women of refugee background who received maternity and/or early parenting care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 41 participants including 17 women of refugee background, who identified as belonging to the Karen, Assyrian Chaldean, Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan, Sudanese, or South Sudanese communities and 24 health and social care professionals who identified as providing pregnancy or early parenting care during the pandemic in the north western suburbs of Melbourne. Interviews with women were conducted in preferred languages by community researchers. Interviews with professionals were conducted in English by researchers. Reflexive thematic data analysis included constructivist positionality and a trauma and violence informed approach. The results reported in this paper include three themes, with four accompanying subthemes, as follows: theme (1), ‘Structural inequities and the toll of the pandemic’; theme (2), ‘Supportive infrastructure’; and theme (3), ‘Cultural safety during the pandemic’. The results demonstrate that cumulative negative impacts such as unequal access to health information, family separation and isolation, inadequate household income, and mental and social health concerns had the potential to amplify pre-existing structural inequities for women of refugee background. Community engagement facilitated by bicultural workers, interpreters, and trusted care providers facilitated fast-paced, two-way communication that built capacity and health literacy for women who were unable to speak English and unfamiliar with the health care system and, improved experiences of care. More research is needed to understand how the intersectional cumulative impacts of structural inequities have affected maternal and neonatal health outcomes for women of refugee background during the pandemic, as well as any differences in maternal and neonatal health outcomes between Australian-born and refugee background women and babies.

N2  - Introduction: Smoking in pregnancy is associated with negative health outcomes for both mothers and babies; e-cigarettes, which contain nicotine without hazardous tobacco, may offer an additional smoking cessation strategy for pregnant women. Although e-cigarettes are being increasingly offered within services, there is limited understanding about whether e-cigarettes can improve smoking cessation support for pregnant individuals. This study aimed to explore service users’ experiences of using e-cigarettes as a tool for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 women who had accepted one of two pilots and were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis. The findings from each site were integrated to develop qualitative insight. Results: Participants largely had positive perceptions of the free and easy-to-use e-cigarette, preferring it to nicotine replacement therapies. The desire to have a healthy pregnancy and baby and the inclusion of non-judgemental behavioural support facilitated motivation to quit. Many participants reduced or quit tobacco use, with positive social and health implications reported. However, numerous barriers to quitting were present and intentions about long-term quitting of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes were mixed and uncertain. Conclusions: Providing e-cigarettes within smoking cessation services was indicated to be a positive and effective strategy for pregnant women trying to quit tobacco. However, numerous barriers to quitting and staying quit remained, suggesting scope for further improvements to smoking cessation support for pregnant women.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging for the mental health of African American (AA) birthing people. The pandemic necessitated shifting mental health care to online interventions. The goals of this study were to (1) describe an adapted evidence-based group preventive intervention for AA mothers with young children within a pediatric setting and (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of this virtual intervention. Phase 1 describes the adaptation of the HealthySteps Mom’s Virtual Wellness Group, including eight weekly sessions based on the Mothers and Babies Course. Phase 2 was a mixed-methods, pre–post intervention design. Six AA mothers with young children completed questionnaires related to depression, anxiety, and parenting competence at three time points: pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 3 months post-intervention (T3). The participants also completed a focus group post-T2 to gather qualitative feedback regarding the intervention. The median scores for depression were lower at T2 and increased at T3, and for anxiety, they increased at T2 and decreased at T3. The median scores for parenting competence increased across the three time points. The participants attended a mean of 7.2 sessions (SD = 0.74). The qualitative results indicate that the participants gained a sense of empowerment, enjoyed connecting with other mothers, and acquired information. This pilot study suggests that a virtual intervention is feasible, acceptable, and can increase parenting competence and support among AA mothers with young children.

N2  - COVID-19 vaccination rates are lower in women of reproductive age (WRA), including pregnant/postpartum women, despite their poorer COVID-19-related outcomes. We evaluated the vaccination experiences of 3568 U.K. WRA, including 1983 women (55.6%) experiencing a pandemic pregnancy, recruited through the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app. Two staggered online questionnaires (Oct–Dec 2021: 3453 responders; Aug–Sept 2022: 2129 responders) assessed reproductive status, COVID-19 status, vaccination, and attitudes for/against vaccination. Descriptive analyses included vaccination type(s), timing relative to age-based eligibility and reproductive status, vaccination delay (first vaccination >28 days from eligibility), and rationale, with content analysis of free-text comments. Most responders (3392/3453, 98.2%) were vaccinated by Dec 2021, motivated by altruism, vaccination supportiveness in general, low risk, and COVID-19 concerns. Few declined vaccination (by Sept/2022: 20/2129, 1.0%), citing risks (pregnancy-specific and longer-term), pre-existing immunity, and personal/philosophical reasons. Few women delayed vaccination, although pregnant/postpartum women (vs. other WRA) received vaccination later (median 3 vs. 0 days after eligibility, p < 0.0001). Despite high uptake, concerns included adverse effects, misinformation (including from healthcare providers), ever-changing government advice, and complex decision making. In summary, most women in this large WRA cohort were promptly vaccinated, including pregnant/post-partum women. Altruism and community benefit superseded personal benefit as reasons for vaccination. Nevertheless, responders experienced angst and received vaccine-related misinformation and discouragement. These findings should inform vaccination strategies in WRA.

N2  - Background: Postpartum depression is a common and serious mental health problem that is affecting an increasing percentage of the world's population. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms in Beijing, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify several potential risk factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted at Peking University First Hospital from 2020 to 2021. Women who delivered and had postpartum reviews at 42 days after delivery were invited to complete the Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) under the guidance of trained nurses. A score of ≥10 was used as the threshold of postpartum depression. t-tests, chi-square tests or Mann–Whitney U tests were applied. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 2462 mothers were included in this study, 20.2 % of whom were considered to have postpartum depressive symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that formula feeding (OR = 2.219, 95 % CI: 1.300–3.786, P = 0.013), preterm birth (OR = 1.619, 95 % CI: 1.108–2.367, P = 0.013), cervical insufficiency (OR 3.022, 95 % CI: 1.200–7.615, P = 0.019) and history of depression (OR = 6.519, 95 % CI: 1.537–27.659, P = 0.011) were associated with a high prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms in developed regions of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. More attention should be given to mothers with risk factors for PPD, and follow-up care is needed.

N2  - Purpose: There is great interest in examining the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health, but most studies were conducted in high-income countries. The identification of overall effects and protective factors is essential to understand the determinants of mental wellbeing in contexts of stress. We aimed to study changes in adolescent mental health during the pandemic and the risk and protective factors associated with these changes in a Brazilian birth cohort. Methods: One thousand nine hundred forty nine adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort were assessed prepandemic (T1, November 2019 to March 2020, mean age 15.69 years) and mid-pandemic (T2, August to December 2021, mean age 17.41 years). Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Prepandemic and pandemic-related predictors were examined as predictors of change in multivariate latent change scores models. Results: There was a mean increase in adolescent total mental health difficulties (M = 1.071, p < .001), hyperactivity/inattention (M = 0.208, p < .001), emotion symptoms (M = 0.409, p < .001), and peer problems (M = 0.434, p < .001) during the pandemic. This increase was associated with several negative family context variables, including harsh parenting and maternal depressive symptoms at T2. Higher emotion regulation levels protected against increases in adolescent mental health difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Family-context variables emerged as important risk factors for the deterioration of adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions promoting emotion regulation strategies are a promising approach to protecting adolescent wellbeing in periods of stress.

N2  - Bacground: Pregnancy and postpartum are sensitive periods for mental health problems due to increased stressors and demands, and the prevalence of intentional self-harming behaviors such as suicidal behavior and ideation may increase. Changes in the provision of prenatal care services and utilization of health services and adverse living conditions during the COVID-19 epidemic may also trigger or exacerbate mental illnesses. Aims: To investigate the prevalence of suicidal behavior and ideation encountered during pregnancy and postpartum period, its change in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related factors. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted. A search was conducted in April 2021 and updated in April 2023 on Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, EBSCO, Turk Medline, Turkish Clinics, and ULAKBIM databases. Two authors independently conducted the search, selection of articles, data extraction, and quality assessment procedures, and an experienced researcher controlled all these steps. Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess the quality of the studies. Results: The meta-analysis included 38 studies and the total sample size of the studies was 9 044 991. In this meta-analysis, the prevalence of suicidal behavior in women during pregnancy and postpartum periods was 5.1 % (95 % CI, 0.01–1.53), suicidal ideation 7.2 % (95 % CI, 0.03–0.18), suicide attampt 1 % (95 % CI, 0.00–0.07) and suicidal plan 7.8 % (95 % CI, 0.06–0.11). Rate of suicidal behavior, ideation/thought increased and attempts in the pandemic process (2.5% vs 19.7 %; 6.3% vs 11.3 %; 3.6% vs 1.4 %, respectively). Prevalences of suicidal behavior, ideation, attempts, and plan in the postpartum period was higher than during pregnancy (1.1% vs 23.4 %; 6.1% vs 9.2 %; 0.5% vs 0.7 %; 7.5% vs 8.8 %, respectively). This systematic review showed that suicidal behavior increases due to many factors such as individual and obstetric characteristics, economic and socio-cultural factors, domestic violence, and a history of physical and mental illness. Conclusion: This study revealed that suicidal behavior in the perinatal period is quite common, especially in high-risk groups, and it increases even more during the pandemic period. Being aware of the sensitivity of the perinatal period in terms of suicidal behavior, healthcare professionals can improve mother-baby health by identifying high-risk groups and providing preventive and health-promoting services.

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic clinical practice in obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) underwent swift and dramatic changes, some transient, others permanent. Training, continuous professional development, educational supervision, and other non-patient facing roles were initially paused. Trainees and trainers saw unprecedented changes to their working patterns. With these changes it is unsurprising there was a significant effect on training in O&G. For the majority obstetric training was unaffected. However, most trainees reported a reduction to their gynaecological training. Furthermore, three quarters of trainees reported COVID had negatively impacted on both their physical and mental well-being. Training recovery has been proactively managed and the impact on progression for many mitigated. There is no doubt the COVID-19 impacted training in O&G. The pandemic has had a greater impact on gynaecological training than obstetric training. The impact on gynaecological operative training persists. The long-term effects on trainees remain to be seen.

N2  - Introduction: The present review focuses on innate-adaptative immune stimulation by COVID-19 vaccines, especially by mRNA-iLNP vaccines. It describes iLNP and nucleoside-modified mRNA technologies, reverse transcription, inflammatory signals linked to reactogenicity, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated vascular crosstalk, induced by systemic and spike protein, which mimic COVID-persistent. Finally, the connection between the manifestation of severe forms of adverse reactions to vaccination and molecular mimicry, the production of particular autoantibodies and the role of certain vaccine adjuvants are discussed in detail. Objectives: To identify articles that publish information on the adverse effects produced after the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in order to demonstrate their therapeutic potential in the treatment-prevention of disease; as well as to demonstrate the association of causality and temporal occurrence. Methodology: Systematic review of the scientific literature published between July 2021 and July 2023, which analyzes all reports of inflammatory signatures of serious adverse effects caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Results: The systematic review identified 2033 records which, after a screening process according to the inclusion criteria and the elimination of duplicated papers, works with methodological problems and works without open access, were reduced to 58 articles, of which 50 articles are human models and 2 are cellular models. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review reveal the causal and temporal association of the various serious adverse events following administration of COVID-19 vaccines and the “peak effect” of COVID-19 vaccines is recognized.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a frequent complication that occurs during the postpartum period. New mothers are at risk of developing psychiatric disorders including depression. Depression leads to impairments in social functioning, quality of life, and increased risk of health problems. In the United States, PPD is experienced by up to one in seven women (American Psychological Association, 2008) with a range of 8 % to 20 % (Webber & Benedict, 2019). Global responses to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 made prevalent existing sexual, reproductive health, and justice inequities among women, girls, and vulnerable populations. Efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the sexual and reproductive health of women with increased cases of domestic violence, deaths among women, and depression. This study aimed to uncover the role of available resources in identifying and treating low-income women with PPD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to interview low-income women of childbearing age (18–51), pregnant, or with children aged 2 or younger to learn from their experiences accessing resources to report symptoms and get treated for PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 8 participants were Latinas between the age of 18–51; with low income defined by their family annual household income and by being a beneficiary of a financial assistance program like WIC and Medicaid; had a baby since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020; had been diagnosed with PPD or with at least five clinical symptoms of PPD (inability to sleep or sleeping much, mood swings, change in appetite, fear of harming herself or the baby, extreme concern and worry about the baby, sadness or excessive crying, feelings of doubt, guilt and helplessness, difficulty concentrating and remembering, loss of interest in hobbies, and thoughts of death) lasting more than 4 weeks. Participants with English or Spanish as their primary language were interviewed. Five themes emerged from the interviews including 1. Fear, anxiety, and loss of interest; 2. Social support; 3. Barriers to screening; 4. Lack of resources for PPD; and 5. The COVID-19 pandemic. Their experiences reflect the lack of communication between patients and health care providers as well as the absence of resources offered to low-income women. There are limitations to this study, including being limited to the experiences of low-income women living in Dallas, Texas. This study is also limited to the perceptions of low-income women who self-identified to be between the ages of 25 to 44 years and Latinas who completed a demographic survey and a one-on-one interview to share their experiences with PPD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was also narrowed by 10 semi-structured questions that the eight study participants were asked.

N2  - Paediatric sleep diagnostics is performed using complex multichannel tests in specialised centres, limiting access and availability and resulting in delayed diagnosis and management. Such investigations are often challenging due to patient size (prematurity), tolerability, and compliance with “gold standard” equipment. Children with sensory/behavioural issues, at increased risk of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), often find standard diagnostic equipment difficult. SDB can have implications for a child both in terms of physical health and neurocognitive development. Potential sequelae of untreated SDB includes failure to thrive, cardiopulmonary disease, impaired learning and behavioural issues. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of SDB is important to facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes. The current gold-standard diagnostic test for SDB is polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive, requiring the interpretation of a highly specialised physiologist. PSG is not feasible in low-income countries or outwith specialist sleep centres. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, efforts were made to improve remote monitoring and diagnostics in paediatric sleep medicine, resulting in a paradigm shift in SDB technology with a focus on automated diagnosis harnessing artificial intelligence (AI). AI enables interrogation of large datasets, setting the scene for an era of “sleep-omics”, characterising the endotypic and phenotypic bedrock of SDB by drawing on genetic, lifestyle and demographic information. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently announced a programme for the development of automated home-testing devices for SDB. Scorer-independent scalable diagnostic approaches for paediatric SDB have potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, accessibility and patient tolerability; reduce health inequalities; and yield downstream economic and environmental benefits.

N2  - Background: Disorders affecting the nervous system are diverse and include neurodevelopmental disorders, late-life neurodegeneration, and newly emergent conditions, such as cognitive impairment following COVID-19. Previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study estimated the burden of 15 neurological conditions in 2015 and 2016, but these analyses did not include neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, or a subset of cases of congenital, neonatal, and infectious conditions that cause neurological damage. Here, we estimate nervous system health loss caused by 37 unique conditions and their associated risk factors globally, regionally, and nationally from 1990 to 2021. Methods: We estimated mortality, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), by age and sex in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2021. We included morbidity and deaths due to neurological conditions, for which health loss is directly due to damage to the CNS or peripheral nervous system. We also isolated neurological health loss from conditions for which nervous system morbidity is a consequence, but not the primary feature, including a subset of congenital conditions (ie, chromosomal anomalies and congenital birth defects), neonatal conditions (ie, jaundice, preterm birth, and sepsis), infectious diseases (ie, COVID-19, cystic echinococcosis, malaria, syphilis, and Zika virus disease), and diabetic neuropathy. By conducting a sequela-level analysis of the health outcomes for these conditions, only cases where nervous system damage occurred were included, and YLDs were recalculated to isolate the non-fatal burden directly attributable to nervous system health loss. A comorbidity correction was used to calculate total prevalence of all conditions that affect the nervous system combined. Findings: Globally, the 37 conditions affecting the nervous system were collectively ranked as the leading group cause of DALYs in 2021 (443 million, 95% UI 378–521), affecting 3·40 billion (3·20–3·62) individuals (43·1%, 40·5–45·9 of the global population); global DALY counts attributed to these conditions increased by 18·2% (8·7–26·7) between 1990 and 2021. Age-standardised rates of deaths per 100 000 people attributed to these conditions decreased from 1990 to 2021 by 33·6% (27·6–38·8), and age-standardised rates of DALYs attributed to these conditions decreased by 27·0% (21·5–32·4). Age-standardised prevalence was almost stable, with a change of 1·5% (0·7–2·4). The ten conditions with the highest age-standardised DALYs in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications due to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancer. Interpretation: As the leading cause of overall disease burden in the world, with increasing global DALY counts, effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for disorders affecting the nervous system are needed.

N2  - The negative effects of alcohol use can transmit intergenerational harm if alcohol use disorder (AUD) occurs during pregnancy and/or while parenting a child. Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of congenital anomalies in the USA, and heavy drinking in women has been on the rise, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study describes the most recent patterns in the past year AUD prevalence and treatment among reproductive-aged women, with a specific focus on pregnant and parenting women, and barriers to treatment among those affected. We analyzed data on reproductive-age women from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2021). We used generalized linear models to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) for past 12-month AUD and its treatment based on DSM-V criteria. We considered sociodemographic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, income, health insurance type, and arrest history. Pregnant and parenting women displayed lower risk for AUD (PR = 0.48, 95% CI:0.41-0.57; PR = 0.5 95% CI:0.48-0.54, respectively) relative to non-pregnant/non-parenting women. Excess risk for AUD was associated with education (some college vs. college graduates, PR = 1.07, 95% CI:1.01-1.13) and history of arrests (PR = 2.93, 95% CI:2.67-3.21). There were no clear differences in AUD treatment use based on parenting or pregnancy status. Among those with AUD, the prevalence of treatment was higher among individuals aged 35-49 years compared to those 18-25 years (PR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.19-2.14) and in those enrolled in Medicaid vs. private insurance (PR = 2.62, 95%CI:1.97-3.47). Financial barriers and treatment not being a priority were the most frequently reported barriers to treatment. To promote well-being among parents and their children, healthcare providers should prioritize reproductive-age women at higher AUD risk. Decreasing the stigma attached to AUD and intensifying efforts to educate women about the dangers of AUD may improve treatment use among pregnant and parenting women.

N2  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a global public health threat. The pandemic overstretched already weak health systems in low- and low-middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. There is a paucity of studies on the impact of COVID-19 on antenatal care access, uptake, and provision in Ethiopia. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 on antenatal care provision in the Sidama region, Ethiopia. Methods A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted between 14 February and 10 May 2022 at 15 public hospitals in the Sidama region. An interrupted times series design was applied for a quantitative study, which included data from all pregnant women who attended antenatal care before COVID-19 (12 months, March 2019 to February 2020) and during COVID-19 (six months, March to August 2020) at 15 public hospitals in the region. The total numbers in the antenatal care 1 cohort (at least one antenatal care contact) and antenatal care 4 cohort (at least four antenatal care contacts) were 15,150 and 5,850, respectively, forming a combined final dataset of 21,000 women. Routinely collected monthly data were derived from the hospitals' health management information system and imported into Stata version 17 for analysis. The mean monthly incidence rate ratio of antenatal care uptake was calculated using a Poisson regression model with a 95% confidence interval. Simultaneously, an exploratory study design was conducted for qualitative using in-depth interviews to explore maternity care providers' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on antenatal care access, uptake, and provision. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. The quantitative and qualitative findings were then integrated using the joint display technique. Results Our findings indicate a significant monthly decrease of 0.7% in antenatal care 1 and 1.8% in antenatal care 4 during the first six months of the pandemic. A lack of medical supplies, fear of contracting COVID-19, inadequate personal protective equipment, discrimination against those attending the hospital, and the absence of antenatal care guidelines for care provision, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and long waiting times for ANC led to disrupted access, uptake, and provision of antenatal care during COVID-19. Conclusion and recommendations Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic affected antenatal care access, uptake, and provision in the study area from March to August 2020. To mitigate disrupted antenatal care access, uptake and provision, antenatal care clinics should be equipped with medical supplies. It is crucial to maintain rapport between the community and maternity care providers and provide training for maternity care providers regarding the adapted/adopted guidelines during COVID-19 at the hospital grassroots level for use in the current and future pandemics. Pregnant women should have timely access to maternity care providers in order to maintain at least a minimum standard of care in current and future pandemics.

N2  - Objective While growing psychological health issues among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic have been clearly validated, most research was conducted in countries with relatively lax quarantine measures. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of prenatal depression among pre-, peak-, and post-COVID-19 in Beijing, the region with a stringent response policy in China. We also explore predictors of prenatal depression throughout the outbreak. Methods We investigated prenatal depression among 742 pregnant women who received antenatal checkups in Beijing from March 28, 2019 to May 07, 2021 using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and associative demographic, pregnancy-related, and psychosocial characteristics were measured. The phase was divided into pre-, peak-, and post-COVID-19 in light of the trajectory of COVID-19. Pearson's Chi-square test was used after the examination of confounders homogeneity. The bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was conducted to explore predictors. Results The pooled prevalence of prenatal depression was 11.9% throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates at different phases were 10.6%, 15.2%, and 11.1% respectively and no significant difference was observed. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that history of mental illness, number of boy-preference from both pregnant women and husband's family, social support, occupation, and living space were independent predictors of prenatal depression in Beijing. Conclusion Our data suggested that the impact of this pandemic on prenatal depression in Beijing appears to be not significant, which will strengthen confidence in adhering to current policy for decision-makers and provide important guidance for the development of major outbreak control and management policies in the future. Our findings may also provide a more efficient measure to identify high-risk pregnant women for professionals and help raise gender equity awareness of pregnant women and their husbands' families. Future studies should focus on the value of targeted care and family relations on the mental health of pregnant women.

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected maternal care services especially for minoritized individuals, creating challenges for both service users (i.e., African American and Hispanic pregnant/postpartum women) and maternal care providers (MCPs). Guided by a socioecological framework, this study aims to investigate the experiences of African American and Hispanic pregnant and postpartum women, as well as MCPs, in accessing and providing maternal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Deep South. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 African American women, 20 Hispanic women, and 9 MCPs between January and August 2022. Participants were recruited from Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics, pediatric clinics, and community health organizations in South Carolina, and all births took place in 2021. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Results Maternal care utilization and provision were influenced by various factors at different socioecological levels. At the intrapersonal level, women’s personal beliefs, fears, concerns, and stress related to COVID-19 had negative impacts on their experiences. Some women resorted to substance use as a coping strategy or home remedy for pregnancy-induced symptoms. At the interpersonal level, family and social networks played a crucial role in accessing care, and the discontinuation of group-based prenatal care had negative consequences. Participants reported a desire for support groups to alleviate the pressures of pregnancy and provide a platform for shared experiences. Language barriers were identified as an obstacle for Hispanic participants. Community-level impacts, such as availability and access to doulas and community health workers, provided essential information and support, but limitations in accessing doula support and implicit bias were also identified. At the institutional level, mandatory pre-admission COVID-19 testing, visitation restrictions, and reduced patient-MCP interactions were women’s common concerns. Short staffing and inadequate care due to the impact of COVID-19 on the health care workforce were reported, along with anxiety among MCPs about personal protective equipment availability. MCPs emphasized the quality of care was maintained, with changes primarily attributed to safety protocols rather than a decline in care quality. Conclusion The pandemic has disrupted maternal care services. To overcome these issues, health facilities should integrate community resources, adopt telehealth, and develop culturally tailored education programs for pregnant and postpartum women. Supporting MCPs with resources will enhance the quality of care and address health disparities in African American and Hispanic women.

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic affected expectant mothers seeking maternal health services in most developing countries. Access and utilization of maternal health services including antenatal care (ANC) attendance and skilled delivery declined drastically resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study assessed pregnancy outcomes before and during COVID-19 pandemic in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana. Methods/Design A retrospective cohort study design was employed. A random sampling technique was used to select 450 women who delivered before or during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tamale Metropolis, Ghana. The respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaire at their homes. In this study, the data collected were socio-demographics characteristics, ANC attendance, before or during pandemic delivery, place of delivery and birth outcomes. Chi-square test and bivariate logistic regression analyses were performed under significant level of 0.05 to determine factors associated with the outcome variables. Result Of the 450 respondents, 51.8% were between 26 and 30 years of age. More than half (52.2%) of the respondents had no formal education and 93.3% were married. The majority (60.4%) of the respondents described their residence as urban setting. About 31.6% of the women delivered before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced place of delivery. The proportion of women who attended at least one ANC visit (84.5% before vs 70.5% during), and delivered at a hospital (76.8% before vs 72.4% during) were higher before the pandemic. More women were likely to deliver at home during COVID-19 (OR: 2.38, 95%CI: 1.52–3.74, p<0.001). Similarly, there was statistically significance difference between before and during COVID-19 delivery on at least one ANC attendance (OR: 2.72, 95%CI: 1.58–1.67, p<0.001). Women who delivered during COVID-19 were about twice more likely to develop complications (OR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.03–2.87, p = 0.04). Conclusion ANC attendance and health facility delivery decreased while pregnancy complications increased during COVID-19. During disease outbreaks, outreach engagement strategies should be devised to increase access and utilization of maternal health services for marginalized and underserved populations. The capacity of health workers should be strengthened through skills training to manage adverse birth outcomes.

N2  - Objectives: To explore the traits and risk factors of pregnant women admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with COVID-19. Moreover, the study classifies outcomes based on differing levels of required respiratory support during their intensive care stay. Methods: This retrospective and descriptive study included all pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the adult critical care unit at a specialized tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Between January 2020 and December 2022. A total of 38 pregnant women were identified and were eligible for our study. Results: The mean age of the patients was 32.9 (19-45) years, and the average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV (APACHI IV) score was 49.9 (21-106). Approximately 60.5% of the patients suffered from superimposed infections during their ICU stay. Approximately 81.6% patients were delivered by C-section, 33 of the newborns survived, and 5 died. The crude mortality rate among pregnant women in our cohort was 15.8%. Patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were mostly discharged or delivered normally, while the mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation groups mostly underwent C-sections. Most of the surviving newborns were on HFNC and MV. Patients with multiple infections had the longest ICU stay and had the highest risk of death. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the characteristics of pregnant women admitted to the ICU at a specialized tertiary healthcare center in Saudi Arabia. The APACHI IV scores accurately predicted patient's mortality, duration of MV, and length of ICU stay. In our study, we shared our experience of managing severe COVID-19 infections in pregnant patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature highlighted an increased risk of child abuse and the use of negative parenting practices. Furthermore, pregnancy during this time may have been challenging and generated different feelings regarding the pandemic and motherhood. Many pregnant women had other young children, underscoring the need to understand this scenario better. Therefore, the present study examined the predictive effect of indicators of mental health disorders, emotional discomfort with motherhood, and negative perceptions of COVID-19 on negative parenting practices. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Pregnant women (n = 303) who had other children younger than six years answered an online questionnaire during the physical distancing period due to COVID-19 in Fortaleza. A partially latent structural equation model (SEM) was used to test direct and indirect relations between the variables. RESULTS: The results revealed a direct positive relation between maternal mental health and the variables COVID-19 feelings, emotional discomfort with motherhood, and negative parenting practices. The stronger relationship was between maternal mental health and emotional discomfort with motherhood. The COVID-19 negative feelings also showed a direct positive relation to emotional discomfort with motherhood. Additionally, older mothers and those with fewer children tended to have less mental health disorders. Furthermore, being in a later trimester of pregnancy was linked to more negative feelings about motherhood. DISCUSSION: The study suggests that mothers experiencing mental health challenges are more likely to feel discomfort with motherhood and use negative parenting practices, highlighting a need for intervention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress during pregnancy is a well-documented risk factor for adverse maternal outcomes. Distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic may further increase the vulnerability of pregnant women to negative mental health outcomes. AIM: To explore the mental health experiences of pregnant women, focusing on mental health outcomes, challenges related to the pandemic, coping strategies, and factors buffering mental health factors during the restricted COVID-19 lockdown period. METHODS: A mixed-methods survey study was conducted, examining symptoms of anxiety, depression, and burnout among 21 pregnant women. Qualitative data were gathered through open-ended questions about participants' experiences of challenges, coping strategies and buffering factors amid the pandemic. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and burnout were calculated, and qualitative data was thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Approximately one-third (24 %) of the respondents reported clinically significant levels of depression, 19 % reported clinically significant levels of anxiety, and 43 % reported experiencing burnout. All participants reported distress and emotional burden, including fear, worry, stress and anxiety related to the pandemic. Specific concerns such as fear of giving birth alone, fear of the consequences due to lockdown restrictions, insufficient information, disruption of prenatal healthcare services, and fear of miscarriage were prevalent among the participants. Social support, financial stability, stable relationships, adherence to daily routines, reduced stress and social demands, a calmer daily life, physical activity, and less work-related stress including working from home, emerges as buffering factors that aided women in coping with pandemic-related distress. CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers should prioritize stability, predictability, and minimizing disruptions to prenatal care. Broad-based screening is crucial to identify women at risk of depression, anxiety, and burnout. Recommendations for clinical pathways aimed at pregnant women are discussed.

N2  - Background: Nurses, midwives and paramedics are the largest collective group of clinical staff in the National Health Service and have some of the highest prevalence of psychological ill-health. Existing literature tends to be profession-specific and focused on individual interventions that place responsibility for good psychological health with nurses, midwives and paramedics themselves. Aim: To improve understanding of how, why and in what contexts nurses, midwives and paramedics experience work-related psychological ill-health; and determine which high-quality interventions can be implemented to minimise psychological ill-health in these professions. Methods: Realist synthesis methodology consistent with realist and meta-narrative evidence syntheses: evolving standards' reporting guidelines. Data sources: First round database searching in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online Database ALL (via Ovid), cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature database (via EBSCO) and health management information consortium database (via Ovid), was undertaken between February and March 2021, followed by supplementary searching strategies (e.g. hand searching, expert solicitation of key papers). Reverse chronology screening was applied, aimed at retaining 30 relevant papers in each profession. Round two database searches (December 2021) targeted COVID-19-specific literature and literature reviews. No date limits were applied. Results: We built on seven key reports and included 75 papers in the first round (26 nursing, 26 midwifery, 23 paramedic) plus 44 expert solicitation papers, 29 literature reviews and 49 COVID-19 focused articles in the second round. Through the realist synthesis we surfaced 14 key tensions in the literature and identified five key findings, supported by 26 context mechanism and outcome configurations. The key findings identified the following: (1) interventions are fragmented, individual-focused and insufficiently recognise cumulative chronic stressors; (2) it is difficult to promote staff psychological wellness where there is a blame culture; (3) the needs of the system often override staff well-being at work ('serve and sacrifice'); (4) there are unintended personal costs of upholding and implementing values at work; and (5) it is challenging to design, identify and implement interventions to work optimally for diverse staff groups with diverse and interacting stressors. Conclusions: Our realist synthesis strongly suggests the need to improve the systemic working conditions and the working lives of nurses, midwives and paramedics to improve their psychological well-being. Individual, one-off psychological interventions are unlikely to succeed alone. Psychological ill-health is highly prevalent in these staff groups (and can be chronic and cumulative as well as acute) and should be anticipated and prepared for, indeed normalised and expected. Healthcare organisations need to (1) rebalance the working environment to enable healthcare professionals to recover and thrive; (2) invest in multi-level system approaches to promote staff psychological well-being; and use an organisational diagnostic framework, such as the NHS England and NHS Improvement Health and Wellbeing framework, to self-assess and implement a systems approach to staff well-being. Future work: Future research should implement, refine and evaluate systemic interventional strategies. Interventions and evaluations should be co-designed with front-line staff and staff experts by experience, and tailored where possible to local, organisational and workforce needs. Limitations: The literature was not equivalent in size and quality across the three professions and we did not carry out citation searches using hand searching and stakeholder/expert suggestions to augment our sample.

N2  - Objectives This study aimed to explore how the unprecedented stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to heightened levels of depression and anxiety among pregnant Indigenous persons, and identify protective individual-level factors. Design The current study used a mixed-methods design including standardised questionnaires and open-ended response questions. Using hierarchical regression models, we examined the extent to which COVID-19-related factors of service disruption (ie, changes to prenatal care, changes to birth plans and social support) were associated with mental well-being. Further, through qualitative analyses of open-ended questions, we examined the coping strategies used by pregnant Indigenous persons in response to the pandemic. Setting Participants responded to an online questionnaire consisting of standardised measures from 2020 to 2021. Participants The study included 336 self-identifying Indigenous pregnant persons in Canada. Results Descriptive results revealed elevated rates of clinically relevant depression (52.7%) and anxiety (62.5%) symptoms among this population. 76.8% of participants reported prenatal care service disruptions, including appointment cancellations. Thematic analyses identified coping themes of staying informed, social and/or cultural connections and activities, and internal mental well-being strategies. Disruptions to services and decreased quality of prenatal care negatively impacted mental well-being of Indigenous pregnant persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Given the potential for mental well-being challenges to persist and long-term effects of perinatal distress, it is important to examine the quality of care that pregnant individuals receive. Service providers should advance policies and practices that promote relationship quality and health system engagement as key factors linked to well-being during the perinatal period for Indigenous persons.

N2  - Introduction Progress related to sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (SRMNCAH) has stalled. COVID-19, conflict and climate change threaten to reverse decades of progress and to ensure the health and well-being of vulnerable populations in humanitarian and fragile settings (HFS) going forward, there is a need for tailored guidance for women, children and adolescents (WCA). This review seeks to map and appraise current resources on SRMNCAH in HFS. Methods In line with the updated Joanna Briggs Institute guidance and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews framework, a manual literature review was conducted of global and regional guidance published between January 2008 and May 2023 from members of the Global Health Cluster, the Global Nutrition Cluster and the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises. A content analysis was conducted. Scores were then calculated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scoring tool and subsequently categorised as high quality or low quality. Results A total of 730 documents were identified. Of these, 141 met the selection criteria and were analysed. Available guidance for delivering SRMNCH services exists, which can inform policy and programming for the general population and WCA. Important gaps related to beneficiaries, health services and health system strengthening strategies were identified. Conclusion The review revealed there is evidence-based guidance available to support interventions targeting WCA in HFS, including: pregnant and lactating women, women of reproductive age, adolescents, newborns, small vulnerable newborns, stillbirths, refugees and internally displaced persons and WCA with disabilities. However, gaps related to beneficiaries, health services and health system strengthening strategies must be addressed in updated guidance that is created, disseminated and monitored in a standardised way that is mindful of the need to respond rapidly in HFS.

N2  - Social support has been proposed as an important determinant of women's physical and emotional well-being during pregnancy and after childbirth. Our study aimed to examine the association between the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) and perceived social support during pregnancy. A web-based prospective study survey was conducted among Polish women. The level of social support was measured with the Berlin Social Support Scales during pregnancy. Four weeks after the birth the risk of PPD was assessed using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Data from 932 mothers aged 19-43 (mean 30.95; SD 3.83) were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Higher perceived available support (emotional and instrumental), currently received support (emotional, instrumental and informational), satisfaction with the support, and sum of score were all associated with lower risk of PPD, after controlling for selected covariates (woman's age, socioeconomic status, parity status, place of residency, education, child's Apgar score, type of delivery, complications during birth, kin assisting the labor, breastfeeding). Our results suggest that the more social support the pregnant woman receives, the lower is her risk of PPD. Since humans evolved as cooperative breeders, they are inherently reliant on social support to raise children and such allomaternal help could improve maternal well-being.

N2  - Less than 30% of people in Africa received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine even 18 months after vaccine development1. Here, motivated by the observation that residents of remote, rural areas of Sierra Leone faced severe access difficulties2, we conducted an intervention with last-mile delivery of doses and health professionals to the most inaccessible areas, along with community mobilization. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 150 communities showed that this intervention with mobile vaccination teams increased the immunization rate by about 26 percentage points within 48–72 h. Moreover, auxiliary populations visited our community vaccination points, which more than doubled the number of inoculations administered. The additional people vaccinated per intervention site translated to an implementation cost of US $33 per person vaccinated. Transportation to reach remote villages accounted for a large share of total intervention costs. Therefore, bundling multiple maternal and child health interventions in the same visit would further reduce costs per person treated. Current research on vaccine delivery maintains a large focus on individual behavioural issues such as hesitancy. Our study demonstrates that prioritizing mobile services to overcome access difficulties faced by remote populations in developing countries can generate increased returns in terms of uptake of health services3.

N2  - Background: The quality of mother-to-infant bonding (MIB) is a crucial determinant of nurturing behaviors and infant development, with bonding difficulties (MIBD) posing a substantial threat. While it is essential to identify MIBD risk factors, previous studies have generally examined MIBD at one time point, leaving the contributors to persistent MIBD uncertain. This study aims to discern longitudinal risk factors for persistent versus episodic MIBD. Methods: We evaluated 1833 postpartum Japanese women who delivered in the past twelve months, utilizing the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS) and other sociodemographic, health, pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing related data (T1). Follow-up data were obtained six months later (T2). MIBD was defined as a MIBS score of five or more, with “persistent” and “episodic” MIBD classified based on its occurrence at both or either one of the time points, respectively. Logistic generalized estimating equations and inverse probability weighting were used to identify risk factors and address selective attribution bias. Results: Of the subjects, 15.8 % reported episodic and 11.3 % reported persistent MIBD. Shared risk factors for both conditions included postpartum depression and low levels of family support (OR = 1.501–6.343). However, pre-pregnancy underweight status (OR = 1.698) was a unique risk factor for episodic MIBD, while first-time motherhood, no or discontinuation of breastfeeding, and later postpartum months (OR = 1.540–3.179) were distinctive risk factors for persistent MIBD. Conclusion: We identified both shared and unique risk factors for episodic and persistent MIBD. Particular attention should be afforded to persistent MIBD and early and proactive interventions to mitigate identified risk factors are recommended.

N2  - Introduction Evidence suggests that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown policies, restriction of movement and physical distancing to control the novel COVID-19 contributed to the decline in utilisation of essential health services. We explored healthcare providers' and policy-makers' experiences of the barriers, interventions and response actions that contributed to ensuring the continuity of essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana to help inform future practice and policy. Methods We used a qualitative study approach. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Thirty Four participants composed of 20 healthcare providers and 14 policy-makers who worked across regions with low and high recorded COVID-19 cases in Ghana during the COVID-19 pandemic were involved in this study. Results Participants reported that essential health services including maternal, reproductive and child health services, communicable and non-communicable disease care, and elective surgeries were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barriers to the utilisation of essential services were constructed into three subthemes: (1) fear, (2) poor quality of care at the facility and (3) financial limitation. These barriers were mitigated with population-based interventions underpinned by the socioecological model at the individual and interpersonal level (including psychosocial care for families and home visits), institutional and community levels (such as allocation of funds, training of health workers, public education, triage stations, provision of logistics, appointment scheduling, telemedicine and redeployment of health workers) and public policy level (tax relief packages, transportation arrangements and provision of incentives), which helped in maintaining essential health services during COVID-19. Conclusion Disruption of essential health services during COVID-19 in Ghana instigated population-based interventions which aided in expanding the populations' continuous access to essential health services and strengthened health service delivery.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 disrupted the delivery of public maternal and child health services to caregivers of preschool children, leading to decreased opportunities for injury prevention education. We aim to 1) explore the timing, content, and methods of providing injury prevention information desired by pregnant women and mothers and 2) identify mothers who experienced difficulty in obtaining injury prevention information owing to reduced maternal and child health services. METHODS: From March 24 to 29, 2022, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study and web-based survey. Of the registered monitors of the internet research company Rakuten Insight, 675 mothers raising their first child aged 0-2 during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 to March 2022) were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Over half of the mothers wanted injury prevention information throughout their pregnancy. They preferred receiving information through traditional face-to-face services provided by local governments, such as antenatal classes or checkups. However, 34.1% of mothers said they did not obtain the information they needed; this was particularly true of unemployed mothers, had children aged 0-1, and had children with illnesses requiring hospital visits. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers who could not obtain injury prevention information were originally disadvantaged mothers concerning access to information. The decrease in maternal and child health services may have widened this information gap. These findings can inform recommendations for caregivers, particularly those susceptible to information gaps during emergencies, and offer insights into future injury prevention education strategies.

N2  - Introduction Infectious disease outbreaks have historically led to widespread disruptions in routine essential health services. Disruptions due to COVID-19 responses led to excess deaths, including among women and children. This review builds on earlier reviews of essential health services in national COVID-19 response and preparedness plans, focusing specifically on maternal, newborn, child, adolescent and ageing health (MNCAAH) in the context of renewed global emphasis on monitoring, recovering and strengthening these services. Methods Using Google searches, we identified publicly available COVID-19 response and preparedness plans authored by a national government body or Public Health Institute from any country, territory and/or area, published between January 2020 and December 2022. We assessed whether each plan considered maintenance of MNCAAH services with related activities, costing or monitoring plans, and whether these considerations were integrated into the national incident management system for COVID-19. Results We identified plans from 110 countries, representing 56% of our sample, in 10 languages. Most plans came from low-income and middle-income countries. Three quarters of dated documents were published between February and April 2020. 22% of plans referenced the impact of COVID-19 on MNCAAH, but only 13% included a planned activity for monitoring or mitigating this impact and less than 5% included relevant indicators, costing or integration of services in the incident management system. Conclusion We propose that unless content specifically related to the services and needs of these populations is integrated, these services will suffer in a future disruptive event. The COVID-19 response demonstrated the need for an interdisciplinary response to address the unforeseen impacts that arose, yet plans continue to have a narrow focus and a generic approach which may be limiting.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been noted to decrease access to maternal health and family planning services globally. However, evidence from the Middle East and North Africa region is very scarce and limited. We qualitatively explored women's experiences in accessing maternal health and family planning services during the COVID-19 lockdown months in the two Egyptian governorates of Port Said and Souhag. METHODS: Using a case study design, semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with a total of 40 women aged 18-35 years from Port Said and Souhag governorates in Egypt. Interviews explored women's experiences in accessing maternal health and family planning services during COVID-19 lockdown months, their coping strategies, and impact of challenges and/or coping strategies on participants and their families. The collected data was analyzed manually using qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Many participants were unable to access maternal health and family planning services during COVID-19 lockdown due to fear of contracting the virus, closure of health facilities, changing service hours, family planning method or drug stock-outs, and/or financial constraints. The above challenges in accessing services along with coping strategies that some women and their families used exposed women to additional health risks, including unintended pregnancies, and posed several social, emotional, and financial burdens to many. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures undermined women's access to maternal and family planning services and interfered with their ability to achieve their reproductive goals. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations to ensure access to maternal and family planning services at times of crisis. Those recommendations include: (1) adapting reliable guidelines from humanitarian settings, (2) providing adequate guidance to healthcare providers and the public to tackle fears and misinformation, (3) making self-care products available such as oral contraceptive pills, vaginal rings and self- administered injectables, (4) involving other health professionals in the provision of maternal and family planning services through task-sharing/shifting, (5) expanding the use of telemedicine and/or digital health services especially to those living in remote areas and (6) raising policymakers' awareness of the centrality of reproductive rights and the importance of protecting them at all times.

N2  - Aging is a significant risk factor for various human disorders, and DNA methylation clocks have emerged as powerful tools for estimating biological age and predicting health-related outcomes. Methylation data from blood DNA has been a focus of more recently developed DNA methylation clocks. However, the impact of immune cell composition on epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) remains unclear as only some clocks incorporate partial cell type composition information when analyzing EAA. We investigated associations of 12 immune cell types measured by cell-type deconvolution with EAA predicted by six widely-used DNA methylation clocks in data from >10,000 blood samples. We observed significant associations of immune cell composition with EAA for all six clocks tested. Across the clocks, nine or more of the 12 cell types tested exhibited significant associations with EAA. Higher memory lymphocyte subtype proportions were associated with increased EAA, and naïve lymphocyte subtypes were associated with decreased EAA. To demonstrate the potential confounding of EAA by immune cell composition, we applied EAA in rheumatoid arthritis. Our research maps immune cell type contributions to EAA in human blood and offers opportunities to adjust for immune cell composition in EAA studies to a significantly more granular level. Understanding associations of EAA with immune profiles has implications for the interpretation of epigenetic age and its relevance in aging and disease research. Our detailed map of immune cell type contributions serves as a resource for studies utilizing epigenetic clocks across diverse research fields, including aging-related diseases, precision medicine, and therapeutic interventions.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major threat to world health and safety, making it the primary concern of global community that requires immediate preventive measures. Several organs are affected by this disease simultaneously with possible long-lasting sequelae. Disease pathogenesis is influenced by, the type of virus and its mutation, the number of viruses, individual’s immune system and their age, gender, nutritional status, homeostasis between the immune, nervous and endocrine systems, and also physical condition. All of these factors play a role in the onset, duration, severity, and recurrence of the disease. Since the exact mechanism of infection with this virus is not fully understood, in this study we aimed to investigate its effects on the reproductive system in male and female as well as pregnancy outcome.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate factors associated with exposure to violence over the past 12 months among women seeking abortion. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study, nested within a multi-center questionnaire survey, involving 623 abortion-seeking women in Sweden from January to June 2021. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, and multivariate regression analysis (using odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [CI]) were employed. Results: Out of the 623 women, 9.9% (n = 59) reported exposure to physical, psychological, and/or sexual violence in the past 12 months. Several factors were correlated with being a victim of violence. However, after adjustment in the regression model, the significant factors included: age 16–26 (OR 2.37, 95% CI; 1.24–4.52, p <.009), poor physical and mental well-being prior to pregnancy (OR 3.29; CI 1.69–6.40, p <.001), having had ≥ 2 previous abortions (OR 2.27, 95% CI; 1.16–4.44, p =.017), and being single (OR 4.70, 95% CI; 2.51–8.77, p <.001). Conclusion: Nearly one in ten women seeking abortion reported exposure to violence in the preceding year. Being young, having poor physical and mental health, undergoing multiple abortions, and singlehood emerge as risk factors for violence exposure. Abortion providers have a crucial role and should consistently identify women exposed to violence, offering them the necessary guidance and referrals for further support.

N2  - Populations identified to be severely affected by COVID-19, such as pregnant patients, require special consideration in vaccine counseling, access, and provider education. Maternal infection with COVID-19 poses a significant risk to the maternal-fetal dyad with known adverse placenta destruction [1-5]. Despite the widespread access and availability of vaccinations, vaccine hesitancy continues to persist and is highly prevalent in pregnant populations [6-9]. Addressing the multitude of social ecological factors surrounding vaccine hesitancy can aid in providing holistic counseling [10]. However, such factors are foremost shaped by maternal concern over possible fetal effects from vaccination. While changes in policy can help foster vaccine access and acceptance, increasing global provider education and incorporation of motivational interviewing skills are the first steps towards increasing maternal acceptance.

N2  - Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have seen an exponential increase in incidence, particularly among pediatric patients. Psychological stress is a significant risk factor influencing the disease course. This review assesses the interaction between stress and disease progression, focusing on articles that quantified inflammatory markers in IBD patients exposed to varying degrees of psychological stress. Methods: A systematic narrative literature review was conducted, focusing on the interaction between IBD and stress among adult and pediatric patients, as well as animal subjects. The research involved searching PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases from 2000 to December 2023. Results: The interplay between the intestinal immunity response, the nervous system, and psychological disorders, known as the gut–brain axis, plays a major role in IBD pathophysiology. Various types of stressors alter gut mucosal integrity through different pathways, increasing gut mucosa permeability and promoting bacterial translocation. A denser microbial load in the gut wall emphasizes cytokine production, worsening the disease course. The risk of developing depression and anxiety is higher in IBD patients compared with the general population, and stress is a significant trigger for inducing acute flares of the disease. Conclusions: Further large studies should be conducted to assess the relationship between stressors, psychological disorders, and their impact on the course of IBD. Clinicians involved in the medical care of IBD patients should aim to implement stress reduction practices in addition to pharmacological therapies.

N2  - Background: Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) affects over 65 million individuals worldwide but treatment options are scarce. We aimed to assess a synbiotic preparation (SIM01) for the alleviation of PACS symptoms. Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a tertiary referral centre in Hong Kong, patients with PACS according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) by random permuted blocks to receive SIM01 (10 billion colony-forming units in sachets twice daily) or placebo orally for 6 months. Inclusion criterion was the presence of at least one of 14 PACS symptoms for 4 weeks or more after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including fatigue, memory loss, difficulty in concentration, insomnia, mood disturbance, hair loss, shortness of breath, coughing, inability to exercise, chest pain, muscle pain, joint pain, gastrointestinal upset, or general unwellness. Individuals were excluded if they were immunocompromised, were pregnant or breastfeeding, were unable to receive oral fluids, or if they had received gastrointestinal surgery in the 30 days before randomisation. Participants, care providers, and investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was alleviation of PACS symptoms by 6 months, assessed by an interviewer-administered 14-item questionnaire in the intention-to-treat population. Forward stepwise multivariable logistical regression was performed to identify predictors of symptom alleviation. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04950803. Findings: Between June 25, 2021, and Aug 12, 2022, 463 patients were randomly assigned to receive SIM01 (n=232) or placebo (n=231). At 6 months, significantly higher proportions of the SIM01 group had alleviation of fatigue (OR 2·273, 95% CI 1·520–3·397, p=0·0001), memory loss (1·967, 1·271–3·044, p=0·0024), difficulty in concentration (2·644, 1·687–4·143, p<0·0001), gastrointestinal upset (1·995, 1·304–3·051, p=0·0014), and general unwellness (2·360, 1·428–3·900, p=0·0008) compared with the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar between groups during treatment (SIM01 22 [10%] of 232 vs placebo 25 [11%] of 231; p=0·63). Treatment with SIM01, infection with omicron variants, vaccination before COVID-19, and mild acute COVID-19, were predictors of symptom alleviation (p<0·0036). Interpretation: Treatment with SIM01 alleviates multiple symptoms of PACS. Our findings have implications on the management of PACS through gut microbiome modulation. Further studies are warranted to explore the beneficial effects of SIM01 in other chronic or post-infection conditions.

N2  - Background: Prepartum and postpartum maternal symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression are likely to influence the child’s sensory processing through hormonal alterations and an influence on mother–child interactions. Objective: We investigated the associations between maternal prepartum and postpartum symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic and childhood sensory avoidance at 18 months. Methods: Longitudinal data from 409 participants followed during the COVID-19 pandemic were used. They completed questionnaires during pregnancy and up to 18 months after delivery. Maternal distress symptoms were assessed prenatally and at 18 months postnatally using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders 7-item Scale and a 10-point scale assessing the level of stress felt related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Child sensory avoidance was assessed at 18 months postpartum using the Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile—Second Edition. Pearson correlations and multiple regressions measured the associations between maternal distress symptoms and child sensory avoidance. Results: Prepartum and 18-month postpartum maternal depression and anxiety were significantly correlated with childhood sensory avoidance (p < 0.05). Together, these variables explained 7.18% (F = 2.12, p < 0.05) of the variance of childhood sensory avoidance. Conclusions: These results support the contributory effect of prepartum and postpartum maternal distress on childhood sensory development.

N2  - American Indian (AI) women are at risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) due to the higher prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and risky drinking. The Native Changing High-Risk Alcohol Use and Increasing Contraception Effectiveness Study (Native CHOICES) was implemented in partnership with a Northern Plains Tribal community to address the effectiveness of a brief, motivational interviewing-based intervention to reduce AEP risk among adult AI women. A subgroup of the participants shared their perspectives in a qualitative interview conducted following the completion of the six-month post-baseline data collection. These interviews solicited participant perspectives on the Native CHOICES intervention and its satisfaction, reach, acceptability, and sustainability. The participants were delighted with Native CHOICES, felt the intervention helped them learn about AEP prevention and goal setting, learned valuable lessons, and believed Native CHOICES would be well-received by other women in their community and should be continued. The participants also shared how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their choices about drinking and birth control. The findings showed the receptivity to and acceptance of Native CHOICES among AI women. The interview findings offered a glimpse into the effectiveness of Native CHOICES and how it contributed to participants making healthier choices surrounding drinking and sexual health.

N2  - Background: This research investigates peripartum depression in fathers during COVID-19, focusing on how pandemic-related distress is associated with paternal depressive symptoms and the quality of father–child feeding interactions. The primary objective was to understand if the pandemic has influenced depressive symptoms in new fathers and how these symptoms impact their interactions with their children, especially during feeding. Methods: Utilizing a cross-sectional design, the research employs online surveys and remote observation to gather data from 243 Italian fathers. The analysis involves established psychometric tools like the Symptoms Check-List/90R and the Peritraumatic Distress Index to assess the severity of depressive symptoms and their correlation with father–child interaction exchanges, observed through the SVIA. Results: The fathers’ peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19 was significantly and positively associated with the level of their depressive symptoms and negatively correlated with the quality of their feeding interactions with their children. Moreover, elevated levels of peritraumatic stress were notably predictive of higher instances of depressive symptoms in the fathers. Further, higher levels of stress associated with COVID-19 were predictive of a poorer quality of father–child interactions. Conclusions: This research highlights the need for inclusive perinatal support programs, offering foundational insights into paternal mental health during pandemics.

N2  - Objective: The rate of COVID-19 vaccination hesitation among Iranian pregnant women is around 50%. The objective of the present study was to determine the reasons for the refusal of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant and postpartum women. Materials and methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 304 pregnant and postpartum women in the comprehensive health centers of Yazd, Iran, between October 2022 and April 2023. Researchers collected the data of unvaccinated women through phone calls using a validated questionnaire. Data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of baseline characteristics and reasons for refusing vaccination. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 22. Results: The mean age of the pregnant and postpartum women participating in this study was 28.31 ± 6.47 years. The most common reasons for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine included fear of harming the fetus (32.2%), fear of side effects in the mother (25.7%), disbelief in COVID-19 disease and vaccine (13.8%), lack of information about the vaccine (12.8%), and negative opinions of the media and society (12.8%). Less common reasons included husband's disagreement (8.2%), history of COVID-19 infection (6.9%), gynecologists' disagreement (6.3%), history of infertility (5.9%), and underlying disease (3.3%). Astonishingly, among participants who did not inject a booster dose of the vaccine, 76% reported they didn't receive any training and recommendation on booster dose injection from health providers. Conclusion: Findings highlight that the most common reasons for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine were fear of harming the fetus and fear of side effects in the mother.

N2  - Problem: Midwives all over the world have had to adapt to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue of how they managed to support birthing women, despite the use of PPE, has been insufficiently studied. Background: Midwives support birthing women in one of their most life-changing situations. Having COVID-19 at the time of childbirth makes birthing women even more vulnerable. PPE has been shown to impact the ability of providing support to birthing women. Aim: To describe midwives’ strategies for supporting birthing women while working in full PPE Methods: A qualitative study based on focus group discussons with Swedish midwives. Data were analysed by inductive content analysis. Findings: To support birthing women while in full PPE, the midwives adapted existing working methods, increased collaboration with colleagues, unveiled, adapted to the requirements for contagion prevention, addressed women's concern for the midwife and maintained focus on the birth while remaining mindful of the risk of contagion. Discussion: Midwives adopted strategies in order to uphold provision of support to the birthing women, as well as to address contextual factors related to PPE that hinder provision of support. Conclusion: The respective effects of different PPE types and models on the birth experience should be explored. Explicit strategies for supporting birthing women while working in full PPE must be created and discussed among midwives.

N2  - Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic led to a reorganization of antenatal care including the cancellation or shift into telemedicine of consultations and restrictions to the presence of an accompanying person. The aim was to explore healthcare professionals’ and women's lived experience of such reorganisation consequences on the quality of care and specific challenges they faced, with a particular emphasis on telemedicine and equity. Methods: Exploratory qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions of women and healthcare providers in New Aquitaine (France) and in the Basque Country (Spain). We collected data from a purposive sampling of women (n = 33) and professionals (n = 19) who had received or provided antenatal care in hospitals and ambulatory facilities between March 2020 and December 2021. Participants’ narratives were thematically analysed to identify themes that were subsequently contextualised to the two territories. Results: Antenatal care professionals and pregnant women experienced strong emotions and suffered from organizational changes that compromised the quality and equity of care. The pandemic and associated restrictions were sources of emotional distress, fear and loneliness, especially among more disadvantaged and isolated women. Among professionals, the lack of adequate means of protection and the multiple changes in caring protocols generated burnout, feeling of abandonment and emotional distress. Conclusions: The Covid-19 experience should serve to critically consider the unexpected consequences of reorganising healthcare services and the need to meet patients’ needs, with a particular consideration for disadvantaged groups. Future scenarios of telemedicine generalisation should consider a combination of in presence and remote consultations ensuring antenatal care quality and equity.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is an illness that is difficult for the affected women themselves to recognize. Moreover, many mothers believe that mothers should not complain about the mental difficulties of taking care of their children. Therefore, in addition to self-evaluation for PPD, evaluation from others is also necessary. We aimed to develop a novel measure to screen for PPD based on a parent-rating scale that is administered to the parents of postpartum mothers. The 15-item maternity-monitoring scale by parents (MMSP) was designed and applied to the feasibility cohort (n = 61) and the emergency cohort (n = 55). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (threshold score of 8/9) was used to evaluate a high risk of PPD. An egogram-based index, the over-adaptation index for depression (OAID), was performed along with the EPDS and MMSP. In the feasibility cohort, MMSP was moderately correlated with EPDS. In the emergency cohort, under the circumstance of the state of emergency declaration over the coronavirus disease 2019 in Japan, application of the MMSP was delayed, resulting in the proportion of parents who overlooked PPD symptoms in their daughters increasing from 33 % to 50 %. Our findings suggest that a novel approach of parent-rated PDD screening of postpartum women is potentially possible, and the MMSP is a potential candidate for screening. Moreover, the OAID is also helpful in identifying women with hidden PPD, along with the EPDS. The performance of the MMSP should be confirmed in the parents of patients with PPD diagnosed by psychiatrists.

N2  - A distinction can be drawn between healthcare, where compassion is evident, and the functional delivery of health services. Measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, such as personal protective equipment, telehealth, and visiting restrictions created barriers to service delivery and put pressure on healthcare. Through 37 qualitative interviews with NHS senior managers (n = 11), health professionals (n = 26), and 5 focus group discussions with members of the public (n = 26), we explored experiences of the everyday ethical tensions created as services were being re-established following the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Our analysis enriches an understanding of compassionate care as outlined in NHS operational documents - covering the emotional, moral, and relational components of healthcare beyond the functionalities of treatment. From this analysis, we consider the normative standards underpinning NHS healthcare, concluding that, wherever possible, offering compassionate healthcare to patients and their families should be facilitated, and health professionals should themselves be compassionately supported in the workplace. Our findings foreground the need to consider the consequences of the short-term adoption of a functional treatment approach, including strategies that support health professionals and inform the public, to avoid the long-term damage caused by the fracturing of compassionate healthcare.

N2  - Background: Adults with PKU have difficulty maintaining plasma phenylalanine (Phe) in the range that is safe for neurologic function. Elevated plasma Phe is a risk factor for congenital anomalies and developmental delay in offspring resulting from pregnancies with poor Phe control in women with PKU. Enzyme supplementation with pegvaliase allows adults with PKU to eat an unrestricted diet and have plasma Phe levels in a safe range for pregnancy but pegvaliase has not been approved for use in pregnant females with PKU. We report the results of chart review of 14 living offspring of females affected with PKU who were responsive to pegvaliase and chose to remain on pegvaliase throughout their pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen pregnancies (one triplet pregnancy) and their offspring were identified at eight PKU treatment centers and medical records from pregnancy and birth were submitted for this study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Responses to a dataset were provided to a single center and analyzed. Results: Six females and eight males were born without congenital anomalies and all offspring had normal growth parameters. While mothers had preexisting comorbidities, no additional comorbidities were reported in the offspring. Four of eleven infants (excluding triplet pregnancies) were delivered preterm (36%), a higher rate than the general population (12%). A single first trimester (eight weeks) miscarriage in a 40y was not counted in this cohort of 14 live born infants. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study suggests that pegvaliase is effective at maintaining safe maternal blood Phe levels during pregnancy without deleterious effects on mother or child. A tendency toward premature birth (4/11; 36%) is higher than expected.

N2  - Despite notable advancements in minimizing maternal mortality during recent decades, a pronounced disparity persists between high-income nations and low-to middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in intensive and high-care for pregnant and postpartum individuals. This divergence is multifactorial and influenced by factors such as the availability and accessibility of community-based maternity healthcare services, the quality of preventive care, timeliness in accessing hospital or critical care, resource availability, and facilities equipped for advanced interventions. Complications from various conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unsafe abortions, puerperal sepsis, and, notably, the COVID-19 pandemic, intensify the complexity of these challenges. In confronting these challenges and deliberating on potential solutions, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse around maternal healthcare in LMICs, ultimately striving toward an equitable health landscape where every mother, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic status, has access to the care they require and deserve. The use of traditional and innovative methods to achieve adequate knowledge, appropriate skills, location of applicable resources, and strong leadership is essential. By implementing and enhancing these strategies, limited-resource settings can optimize the available resources to promptly recognize the severity of illness in obstetric individuals, ensuring timely and appropriate interventions for mothers and children. Additionally, strategies that could significantly improve the situation include increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, effective resource management, enhanced supply chain efficiency, and the development and use of low-cost, high-quality equipment. Through targeted investments, innovations, efficient resource management, and international cooperation, it is possible to ensure that every maternal high-care and ICU unit, regardless of geographical location or socioeconomic status, has access to high-quality critical care to provide life-saving care.

N2  - Background: Two years after the WHO declared a state of emergency as a result of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus from Wuhan, China, the rate of new infections experienced intermittent flare-ups globally, with vaccinations still ongoing in countries such as Ghana. One year after the implementation of Ghana's COVID-19 vaccine deployment program, Ghanaians have had the opportunity to reflect on their vaccination decisions, albeit the initial vaccine hesitancy. Objectives: The current paper examined the knowledge and lived experiences of Ghanaians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the factors influencing their vaccination decisions, one year after COVID-19 vaccinations commenced in Ghana, with special focus on the social and geographical histories which influenced their vaccination decisions. Methodology: A qualitative approach using a case study design was used to conduct in-depth interviews among 25 respondents who were 18 years and above, not pregnant, and willing to participate in the study, between 5th and 23rd September 2022. Data was collected in 5 hotspot areas in Ghana with the highest cumulative case counts. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data which was analyzed using a thematic approach. Findings: Respondents demonstrated a good level of knowledge on COVID-19 and related vaccines. Fear, panic, and anxiety were some of the experiences lived by respondents during the pandemic. The factors influencing vaccination decisions included conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and related vaccines, subjective notions about the COVID-19 disease, and subjective notions about the vaccine. The type of community one lived in, taboos, and previous successful vaccination programs in the community were geographic factors that informed respondents’ decision to vaccinate or not. Social circles, religion, opinion leaders, and media-based campaigns were the social factors that influenced respondents’ decision to vaccinate or not.

N2  - Background: Reducing maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remains a paramount goal for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially after COVID-19’s devastating impact on maternal health indicators. We describe our experience implementing the Hospital Padrino Strategy (HPS), a collaborative model between a high-complexity hospital (Fundación Valle del Lili) and 43 medium- and low-complexity hospitals in one Colombian department (an administrative and territorial division) from 2021 to 2022, to sustain the trend towards reducing MMR. The study aimed to assess the effects of implementing HPS on both hospital performance and maternal health indicators in Valle del Cauca department (VCD). Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted, comprising two phases. In the first phase, we investigated a cohort of hospitals through prospective follow-up to assess the outcomes of HPS implementation on hospital performance and maternal health indicators in VCD. In the second phase, qualitative data were collected through focus groups with 131 health workers from 33 hospitals to explore the implications of the HPS implementation on healthcare personnel. All data were obtained from records within the HPS implementation and from the Health Secretary of VCD. Findings: Evidence shows that in the context of HPS, 51 workshops involved 980 healthcare workers, covering the entire territory. Substantial improvements were observed in hospital conditions and healthcare personnel's technical competencies when providing obstetric care. Seven hundred eighty-five pregnant women with obstetric or perinatal emergencies received care through telehealth systems, with a progressive increase in technology adoption. Nine percent required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and none died. The MMR decreased from 78.8 in 2021 to 12.0 cases per 100,000 live births by 2022. Improvements in indicators and conducted training sessions instilled confidence and empowerment among the healthcare teams in the sponsored hospitals, as evidenced in focus groups derived from a sample of 131 healthcare workers from 33 hospitals. Interpretation: Implementing the Hospital Padrino Strategy led to a significant MMR reduction, and consolidated a model of social healthcare innovation replicable in LMICs. Funding: The Hospital Padrino Strategy was funded by the Fundación Valle del Lili and the Health Secretary of Valle del Cauca. Furthermore, this study received funding from a general grant for research from Tecnoquimicas S.A.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: Do involuntary definitive childless women have lower psychosocial adjustment levels than women with infertility diagnoses actively trying to conceive and presumably fertile women? SUMMARY ANSWER: Involuntary definitive childless women have lower levels of sexual functioning than infertile women actively trying to conceive and presumably fertile women, and higher levels of depression than presumably fertile women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Involuntary definitive childless defines those who wanted to become parents but were unable to do so. Studies have provided evidence about infertility and its psychosocial consequences, but there is a lack of knowledge about the impact of involuntary definitive childlessness, namely on sexual function, social support, marital satisfaction, and psychological adjustment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This associative study was conducted between July 2021 and January 2022 for involuntary definitive childless women and between July 2016 and February 2018 for women with an infertility diagnosis actively trying to conceive as well as presumably fertile women. An online questionnaire announced in social media and gynaecology and fertility clinics was used. The inclusion criteria for all participants were being childless, in a heterosexual relationship and cohabiting for at least 2 years. Specific inclusion criteria for involuntary definitive childless women were: trying to conceive for at least 2 years; not achieving pregnancy because of biological and medical constraints; and not undergoing fertility treatment or being a candidate for adopting a child at time of the study. For women with an infertility diagnosis the inclusion criteria were: actively trying to conceive (naturally or through fertility treatments); having a primary fertility diagnosis; and aged between 22 and 42 years old. For presumably fertile women, the inclusion criteria were: having a parenthood wish in the future; and not knowing of any condition that could prevent them from conceiving. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Out of 360 women completing the survey, only 203 were eligible for this study (60 involuntary definitive childless women, 78 women with an infertility diagnosis actively trying to conceive, and 65 presumably fertile women). All participants completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic and clinical data, the Female Sexual Function Index, the 2-Way Social Support Scale, the Relationship Assessment Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the relation between sexual function, social support, marital satisfaction, anxiety, depression, and reproductive status, adjusting for age, and cohabitation length. Presumably fertile women were used as a reference group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Women were 34.31 years old (SD ¼ 5.89) and cohabited with their partners for 6.55 years (SD ¼ 4.57). The odds ratio (OR) showed that involuntary definitive childless women had significantly lower sexual function than infertile women actively trying to conceive (OR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI ¼ 0.79–0.99) and presumably fertile women (OR ¼ 34.89, 95% CI ¼ 1.98–614.03), and higher depression levels than presumably fertile women (OR ¼ 99.89, 95% CI ¼ 3.29–3037.87). Women with an infertility diagnosis actively trying to conceive did not differ from presumably fertile women in sexual function, social support, marital satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The majority of childless women underwent fertility treatments, and childlessness for circumstantial reasons owing to lack of a partner was not included, therefore these results may not reflect the experiences of all women with an involuntary childless lifestyle. There was a time gap in the recruitment process, and only the definitive childlessness group filled out the questionnaire after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We did not ask participants if they self-identified themselves with the groups’ terminology they were assigned to. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results emphasize the importance of future research to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the adjustment experiences of childless women and an awareness of the poor adjustment they might experience, highlighting the need to keep following women after unsuccessful treatments. Clinical practitioners must attend to these dimensions when consulting involuntary definitive childless women who might not have gone through treatments but also experience these adverse outcomes. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was partially supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted pregnant and breastfeeding women. Both low- and high-risk groups adopted preventive approaches such as mask-wearing and handwashing to slow down and prevent viral transmission during critical periods that may affect mother-child interactions. METHODS: A longitudinal observational study was conducted with primiparous women recruited using convenience sampling from the postpartum care ward of Afzalipour Teaching Hospital in Kerman from August 1, 2020 to March 30, 2021. The research questionnaires included demographic information, preventive behaviors, breastfeeding intention and practices, postpartum distress, and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. All the questionnaires were self-reported online in three stages: before discharge from the postpartum ward, the first month after delivery, and the third month after delivery. RESULTS: A Total of 160 primiparous women were included. The results showed significant changes in preventive behaviors and postpartum distress levels during the study. Breastfeeding intention and practices were negatively affected by postpartum distress (P = 0.034), unwanted pregnancies (P = 0.009), and cesarean delivery (P < 0.001). Postpartum distress was directly affected by the presence of depression (P < 0.001). Preventive behaviors at discharge were significantly associated with postpartum distress three months after delivery (P = 0.013). The study also found an association between women's and partner's education, unwanted pregnancy, and cesarean delivery that determined postpartum distress. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic restrictions did not affect breastfeeding intentions or practices, possibly due to sufficient social and family support during the pandemic. However, robust guidelines are required to increase enable women's access to specializede care to cope with future pandemics, particularly during the first few weeks after childbirth.

N2  - AIM: To generate, test and refine programme theories that emerged from a rapid realist review investigating practising UK Nurses' and Midwives' experiences of effective leadership strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The realist review of literature generated six tentative theories of healthful leadership practices reflecting, working with people's beliefs and values; being facilitative; multiple means of communication and; practical support. The review yielded little insight into the actual impact of the leadership approaches advocated. METHODS: A realist study, informed by person-centredness using mixed-methods. Online survey (n = 328) and semi-structured interviews (n = 14) of nurses and midwives across the UK in different career positions/specialities. Quantitative data analysed using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. Framework analysis for qualitative data using context (C), mechanism (M), outcome (O) configurations of the tentative theories. RESULTS: Three refined theories were identified concerning: Visibility and availability; embodying values and; knowing self. Healthful leadership practices are only achievable within organisational cultures that privilege well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Leaders should intentionally adopt practices that promote well-being. 'Knowing self' as a leader, coaching and mentoring practice development is important for leadership development. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses who feel valued, heard, cared for and safe are more likely to remain in clinical practice. Job satisfaction and being motivated to practice with confidence and competence will impact positively on patient outcomes. IMPACT: The study addresses the role of leadership in developing healthful workplace cultures. The main findings were six leadership practices that promote healthful cultures. The research will have an impact on strategic and clinical leaders, nurses and midwives. REPORTING METHOD: This study used EQUATOR checklist, RAMASES II as reporting standards for realist evaluations. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the prevalence of postpartum depression and anxiety symptomatology among fathers of Asian descent living in North America during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) to identify the occurrences of online racial discrimination. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design and convenience sampling methods, we recruited fathers online via social media sites (Facebook, Instagram) between March 12 and July 31, 2022. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, General Anxiety Scale, and the Online Victimization Scale assessed mental health well-being and discrimination outcomes. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, two sample t-test, chi-square test of independence, and Pearson's correlation analysis. RESULTS: Our sample included 61 fathers within 6 months postpartum living in the United States and Canada. Participants were on average 34 years old, married, and represented 17 Asian ethnic groups, including Asian Indian (41%), Filipino (11.3%), and Korean (8.1%). One-third of our participants (31.1%, n = 19) were at high risk of developing postpartum depression and scores of three (4.9%) fathers indicated they had clinically significant anxiety. Overall, 26.3% reported experiencing direct online racial discrimination and 65% reported occurrences of indirect online racial discrimination. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: There was a high rate of depressive symptoms and occurrences of online racial discrimination among fathers of Asian descent living in North America. These rates are higher than the general perinatal population and further research is warranted to examine risk factors and preventive strategies among this unique paternal ethnic group.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased anxiety among pregnant women, and at the same time, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected communities of color in the United States. We sought to understand how self-identied Black pregnant women in the United States were affected in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, online survey distributed via social media SETTING: Online PARTICIPANTS: Non-probability, convenience sample of self-identified Black pregnant women in the United States between April 3 and 24, 2020 who responded to an online inquiry seeking women who were pregnant at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: An anonymous, self-administered, online survey of pregnant women was conducted, including both quantitative assessment of demographics, COVID-related anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety as well as open-ended prompts for qualitative assessment of the impact of COVID on prenatal care, birth plans, anxiety and overall experience of pregnancy. Quantitative data were analyzed using Stata 15.0, qualitative data were thematically analyzed using NVivo12.1. Results were compared using joint display methodology. Of 87 self-identified Black or African-American women who responded, the most common concerns related to fear of getting infected with COVID (89.7 %, N = 78) and concerns related to loss of job/income (67.8 %, N = 59). More than half (55.2 %, N = 48) reported either themselves or their family members working in essential services. Findings indicate that uncertainty, lack of support, perceived quality of care, and heightened anxiety worked together to define Black women's experiences of pregnancy in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. While quantitative data did not explicitly capture reports of discrimination as impacting perceived quality of care, the qualitative data suggest a link between fears of discrimination, the need for self-advocacy, and heightened anxiety. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Despite being a relatively well-educated sample of Black women from around the United States, many respondents spoke of the fears of discrimination, the need for self-advocacy, and heightened anxiety, reinforcing that discrimination and fear of discrimation for Black women in healthcare settings are pervasive, regardless of a woman's level of education or other socioeconomic status indicators. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that in times of uncertainty, such as the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to provide thoughtful, supportive care to pregnant women of color who are primed for negative experiences in the healthcare settting.

N2  - Background: About one in 11 adults worldwide suffers from diabetic disease with constantly increasing prevalence; from the 529 million patients registered in 2021, the number of people with diabetes was predicted to rise to approximately 1.31 billion in 2050. In Italy, 5.9% of the population is diabetic, with a higher prevalence with increasing age and in the South of the country. Yoga and Mindfulness could represent a valid support for the care of diabetic subjects especially in a stressful caring context such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Study Design: A scoping review was conducted to achieve the goals of the study. Yoga or Mindfulness interventions on diabetic subjects were specifically analyzed and qualitative-quantitative data collected in the selected randomized controlled trials were extensive for possible meta-analysis. Methods: The review was conducted by two independent practitioners and a third one was consulted in case of conflict. The PRISMA method was used for both the selection and reporting of the studies to be included. Specific PICOS and search strategies have been developed on PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Included in the review were: randomised controlled trials, full dissertation articles and papers in English with a time limit on May 31, 2022. Results: The Review included 22 studies; 12 on Mindfulness, 9 on Yoga and one about both disciplines; among these, one studied patients with Type 1 Diabetes, 14 with Type 2 Diabetes, 6 with both and one with Gestational Diabetes. Only one paper studied adolescent subjects while the other 21 focused on a range of adult subjects. The studies showed that Yoga and Mindfulness have strong potential not only on stress management, but also on clinical-metabolic parameters. Conclusions: The recent Covid-19 pandemic has certainly redesigned a new way of treating and managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. An increasingly fragile population, and with the growing need to reduce overall stress levels, could find alternative practices in Yoga and Mindfulness to support conventional therapies.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on multi-level factors associated with depression among a high-risk sample of postpartum women using longitudinal data collected at two timepoints. High-risk postpartum participants in the United States were recruited to participate in a parent study focused on mitigating risk of cardiometabolic disease in postpartum women. Individuals completed a baseline survey which included the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6-weeks postpartum between 2017 through 2019. A modified survey with the inclusion of selected questions from the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) questionnaire was administered again during the first 6-months of the COVID-19 pandemic and individuals who completed both the baseline assessment and the COVID-19 assessment were included for analyses (n = 46). Multivariate models were run to investigate the impacts of individual-, interpersonal-, and structural-level factors on change in EPDS scores across the postpartum period. Findings suggest that losing contact with social supports (β = 4.5, SE = 1.9, p = .02) and individuals who reported a total household income of less than $75,000 (β = 3.4, SE = 1.7, p = .05) were more likely to report significantly worsening postpartum depression scores compared to others. Recommendations to mitigate the stressors that have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mental health disparities include screening all high-risk postpartum women for depression and anxiety during both postpartum and pediatric healthcare visits, providing informational flyers with tips related to healthy coping behaviors and free/affordable community resources, and linking individuals to peer-led support groups.

N2  - To identify pregnant women's attitudes towards, and acceptance and rejection of, COVID-19 vaccination. This prospective, descriptive, implementation study was conducted in the Antenatal clinic of Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. In Phase I, 40 pregnant women were interviewed. Phase II consisted of questionnaire development and data validation. In Phase III, the questionnaire was administered to 400 participants. Pregnant women's attitudes towards and acceptance and rejection of COVID-19 vaccination. Most pregnant women were uncertain about the potential harm of vaccination to themselves or their unborn child, including risks such as miscarriage or premature birth (59-66/101 [58.4%-65.3%]; OR 2.53-8.33; 95% CI 1.23-3.60, 5.17-19.30; P < 0.001) compared to those who disagreed with vaccination. Their vaccination decisions were significantly influenced by social media information regarding vaccination complications in pregnant women (74/101 [73.3%]; OR 15.95; 95% CI 2.15-118.55; P = 0.001) compared to those who disagreed with vaccination. Most pregnant women opined that they should not receive a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.57; 95% CI 2.44-17.70; P = 0.001). Most also rejected vaccination despite being aware of its benefits (AOR 17.14; 95% CI 6.89-42.62; P < 0.001). Social media messages and obligatory vaccination certifications influence maternal vaccination decisions. Pregnant women believe vaccination helps prevent COVID-19 infection and reduces its severity. Nevertheless, the primary reason for their refusal was concern about potential harm to their unborn child or themselves during pregnancy.The Thai clinical trials registry: TCTR20211126006.

N2  - Importance: Pursuant to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), continuous Medicaid eligibility during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) created a de facto national extension of pregnancy Medicaid eligibility beyond 60 days postpartum. Objective: To evaluate the association of continuous Medicaid eligibility with postpartum health insurance, health care use, breastfeeding, and depressive symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study using a generalized difference-in-differences design included 21 states with continuous prepolicy (2017-2019) and postpolicy (2020-2021) participation in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Exposures: State-level change in Medicaid income eligibility after 60 days postpartum associated with the FFCRA measured as a percent of the federal poverty level (FPL; ie, the difference in 2020 income eligibility thresholds for pregnant people and low-income adults/parents). Main Outcomes and Measures: Health insurance, postpartum visit attendance, contraceptive use (any effective method; long-acting reversible contraceptives), any breastfeeding and depressive symptoms at the time of the PRAMS survey (mean [SD], 4 [1.3] months postpartum). Results: The sample included 47 716 PRAMS respondents (64.4% aged <30 years; 18.9% Hispanic, 26.2% non-Hispanic Black, 36.3% non-Hispanic White, and 18.6% other race or ethnicity) with a Medicaid-paid birth. Based on adjusted estimates, a 100% FPL increase in postpartum Medicaid eligibility was associated with a 5.1 percentage point (pp) increase in reported postpartum Medicaid enrollment, no change in commercial coverage, and a 6.6 pp decline in uninsurance. This represents a 40% reduction in postpartum uninsurance after a Medicaid-paid birth compared with the prepolicy baseline of 16.7%. In subgroup analyses by race and ethnicity, uninsurance reductions were observed only among White and Black non-Hispanic individuals; Hispanic individuals had no change. No policy-associated changes were observed in other outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, continuous Medicaid eligibility during the COVID-19 PHE was associated with significantly reduced postpartum uninsurance for people with Medicaid-paid births, but was not associated with postpartum visit attendance, contraception use, breastfeeding, or depressive symptoms at approximately 4 months postpartum. These findings, though limited to the context of the COVID-19 PHE, may offer preliminary insight regarding the potential impact of post-pandemic postpartum Medicaid eligibility extensions. Collection of longer-term and more comprehensive follow-up data on postpartum health care and health will be critical to evaluating the effect of ongoing postpartum policy interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fear of childbirth (FOC) is a common problem associated with psycho-social factors in pregnant women. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the mediator of social support and the moderator role of fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the relationship between self-efficacy and FOC in pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 422 pregnant women registered in 18 family health centers. Data were collected with the introductory information form, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire-A, the Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Fear of COVID19 Scale. The SPSS 22 package program and Hayes's process macro 3.2 were used in the analysis of the data. RESULTS: Findings showed that 19.9% of the pregnant women experienced severe FOC. Self-efficacy and social support negatively predicted FOC, while fear of COVID-19 predicted it positively. Perceived social support moderately mediated the relationship between FOC and self-efficacy. Fear of COVID-19 was found to be a marginally effective moderator in the relationship between self-efficacy and FOC. This indicates that as self-efficacy increases in pregnant women with low fear of COVID-19, the FOC is experienced less. CONCLUSION: In the relationship between self-efficacy and FOC, social support is a key factor in reducing FOC. To reduce the FOC, the social support of pregnant women should be strengthened, and the fear associated with acute crisis periods such as pandemics should be reduced with some preventive measures.

N2  - The number of mothers suffering from mental illness is increasing steadily, particularly under conditions of the coronavirus pandemic. The identification of factors that contribute to resilience in mothers is urgently needed to decrease the risks of poor physical and psychological health. We focused on the risk of parenting stress and psychological resilience in healthy mothers with no psychiatric and physical disorders and conducted two studies to examine the relationships between intestinal microbiota, physical condition, and psychological state. Our results showed that alpha diversity and beta diversity of the microbiome are related to high parenting stress risk. Psychological resilience and physical conditions were associated with relative abundances of the genera Blautia, Clostridium, and Eggerthella. This study helps further understand the gut-brain axis mechanisms and supports proposals for enhancing resilience in mothers.

N2  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has offset some of the gains achieved in global health, particularly in relation to maternal, child health and nutrition. As pregnancy is a period of plasticity where insults acting on maternal environment have far-reaching consequences, the pandemic has had a significant impact on prenatal outcomes, intrauterine and postnatal development of infants. This research will investigate both the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during pregnancy on prenatal outcomes, growth and development in early childhood. Methods and analysis Community and hospital data in Hyderabad and Gujarat, India will be used to recruit women who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic and contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection. In comparison with women who were pregnant around the same time and did not contract the virus, the study will investigate the impact of the pandemic on access to healthcare, diet, nutrition, mental health and prenatal outcomes in 712 women (356 per study arm). Children born to the women will be followed prospectively for an 18-month period to investigate the impact of the pandemic on nutrition, health, growth and neurocognition in early childhood. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted from the institutional ethics committees of the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar (SHSRC/2021/2185), Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition (EC/NEW/INST/2021/1206), and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (72848). The findings of the study will be disseminated to policy and research communities through engagements, scientific conferences, seminars, and open-access, peer-reviewed publication.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected access to essential healthcare services. This study aimed to explore healthcare providers' perceptions and experiences of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in three referral maternal and neonatal hospitals in Guinea. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study between June and December 2020 in two maternities and one neonatology referral ward in Conakry and Mamou. Participants were purposively recruited to capture diversity of professional cadres, seniority, and gender. Four rounds of in-depth interviews (46 in-depth interviews with 18 respondents) were conducted in each study site, using a semi-structured interview guide that was iteratively adapted. We used both deductive and inductive approaches and an iterative process for content analysis. RESULTS: We identified four themes and related sub-themes presented according to whether they were common or specific to the study sites, namely: 1) coping strategies & care reorganization, which include reducing staffing levels, maintaining essential healthcare services, suspension of staff daily meetings, insertion of a new information system for providers, and co-management with COVID-19 treatment center for caesarean section cases among women who tested positive for COVID-19; 2) healthcare providers' behavior adaptations during the response, including infection prevention and control measures on the wards and how COVID-19-related information influenced providers' daily work; 3) difficulties encountered by providers, in particular unavailability of personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of financial motivation, and difficulties reducing crowding in the wards; 4) providers perceptions of healthcare service use, for instance their fear during COVID-19 response and perceived increase in severity of complications received and COVID-19 cases among providers and parents of newborns. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights needed to be considered to improve the preparedness and response of healthcare facilities and care providers to future health emergencies in similar contexts.

N2  - Introduction: effective COVID-19 vaccines for the prevention of severe illness have been available for more than one year now. This study was carried out to ascertain vaccine hesitancy and its associations among pregnant women receiving antenatal care in Port Harcourt, a large cosmopolitan town in Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional online survey over 2 months among consenting pregnant women receiving antenatal care in the 3 largest obstetric service centers in Port Harcourt to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associations. Results: the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 669 (72.2%). Of the respondents, 27 (2.9%) had been infected or had a close family member infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 897 (96.8%) of them had heard of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, only 133 (14.4%) had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The safety of the mother in 260 (32.8%) and the safety of the unborn baby in 114 (14.4%) of the respondents were the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. A small proportion of women 7(0.9%) were hesitant on religious grounds. Tertiary education, use of childhood immunization for previous infants delivered, and availability of COVID-19 vaccine in the antenatal clinic at no cost to the women, were statistically significant predictors of vaccine uptake among the respondents. Conclusion: the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Port Harcourt was 72.2%. Higher academic achievement and availability of the COVID-19 vaccine in the antenatal clinic were predictors of vaccine uptake, while reasons for hesitancy were mostly due to safety concerns for the mother and unborn baby.

N2  - Introduction: Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and comorbidity increased in junior high school students due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to measure the impacts of parenting style on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and their comorbidity in Chinese junior high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. Methods: An online survey was conducted in June 2020 among 3117 junior high school students from Shandong Province, China. The Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran scale was used to measure parenting styles. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scale and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale were used to measure depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted with SPSS 25.0 Version. Results: 3117 junior school students enrolled in this study. The prevalence of depressive symptoms only, anxiety symptoms only, and comorbidity among junior high school students was 11.55 %, 5.29 %, and 22.97 %. Paternal over-protection was a risk factor not only for depressive symptoms only (OR = 1.075, 95 % CI = 1.020–1.134) but for anxiety symptoms only (OR = 1.090, 95 % CI = 1.016–1.170) and comorbidity (OR = 1.098, 95 % CI = 1.050–1.148). Paternal over-interference was a protective factor for depressive symptoms only (OR = 0.947, 95 % CI = 0.908–0.987) and comorbidity (OR = 0.953, 95 % CI = 0.921–0.986). However, maternal over-interference and over-protection were risk factors for depressive symptoms only (OR = 1.039, 95 % CI = 1.011–1.068). Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study and the causal inferences could not be conducted. Conclusions: Junior high school students with poorer family environmental factors were more likely to suffer from the comorbidity of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Decision-makers from the government, educational, and healthcare institutions should pay more attention to junior high school students at higher risk of mental disorders due to poor parenting styles. We should discuss family interventions in the future to prevent mental disorders in junior high school students.

N2  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccination is vital for ending the pandemic, yet safety concerns persist among pregnant and postpartum women, especially those who are Black and Hispanic. This study aims to explore factors that influence postpartum women's vaccination decision-making during pregnancy and postpartum through women's lived experiences and maternal care providers' (MCPs) observations. METHODS: From January to August 2022, we conducted semi-structured interviews with postpartum women who are Black and Hispanic and with MCPs. Participants were recruited from obstetric and pediatric clinics in South Carolina and had given birth in 2021. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. RESULTS: The study involved 19 Black and 20 Hispanic women, along with 9 MCPs, and revealed both barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. The factors that influence pregnant and postpartum women's decision about COVID-19 vaccine uptake included: 1) awareness of health threats associated with COVID-19 vaccines, 2) vaccine availability and accessibility, 3) vaccine-related knowledge and exposure to misinformation, 4) concerns regarding pre-existing health conditions and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, 5) emotional factors associated with vaccination decision-making processes, 6) concerns about the well-being of infants, 7) cultural perspectives, and 8) encouragement by trusted supporters. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that reliable information, social support, and trusted MCPs' advice can motivate COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant and postpartum women who are Black and Hispanic. However, barriers such as misinformation, mistrust in the health care system, and fears of potential side effects impede vaccination uptake. Future interventions should address these barriers, consider health disparities, involve trusted MCPs, and initiate conversations about vaccines to promote vaccination among these populations.

T1  - Rapid nursing redeployment from a specialist ward to a COVID-19 high-dependency setting
LA  - English
N2  - BACKGROUND: Redeployment in health care can have a negative impact on the mental wellbeing of staff. Advanced planning and provisions for wellbeing support for health professionals has been recommended following previous pandemics. At the authors' institution nurses were redeployed overnight from a specialist cystic fibrosis ward to a COVID-19 high-dependency unit. AIM: To evaluate nurses' wellbeing following this redeployment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A mixed online survey, consisting of both open and closed questions, based on literature, preliminary results of the Impact of COVID-19 on the Nursing and Midwifery Workforce (ICON) study and staff feedback. This was sent to 28 nurses to explore their feelings and experiences of redeployment to a COVID-19 environment. Purposive sampling was used to select study participants while thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: The survey had an 86% response rate. Using thematic analysis three key themes emerged: redeployment anxiety, lack of organisational preparedness and newfound teamworking. More than half (57%) of respondents expressed anxiety and concern when told of their redeployment; 52% reported that they did not receive adequate support from senior staff and management. However, 74% reported that they felt their nursing was positively influenced by support and teamwork from those in patient-facing roles. Twenty-five percent reported that they were looking for a new job or leaving their current role. CONCLUSION: This study examines the effects that redeployment to a COVID-19 environment has had on nurses. It highlights the need for further improvement to ensure redeployed staff are supported to safeguard their mental wellbeing.

N2  - Little is known about the healthcare utilization of mothers and birthing parents experiencing elevated levels of symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined how healthcare utilization changed in these individuals during COVID-19. Individuals living in Ontario, Canada, with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Scores ≥ 10 were recruited into two separate randomized controlled trials of a 1-day intervention for PPD before (pre-COVID-19, n = 441) and during the pandemic (COVID-19, n = 287). Participants in both samples completed the same health resource use questionnaire, self-reporting the number of virtual and/or in-person visits to specific healthcare services over the three months preceding their treatment intervention. Use of medications, mental health care, primary care, hospital-based care, allied health care, and overall healthcare utilization were compared between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups. While participants had higher levels of PPD symptoms during COVID-19, differences were not seen in the use of specific categories of care (e.g. mental health and primary care). However, before and after statistically adjusting for covariates, overall healthcare utilization decreased from an average of 9.5 visits prior to COVID-19 to 6.9 during COVID-19 (p < .001), a change that was at least partly contributed to by reductions in visits to allied health professionals (e.g. dentists and physiotherapists). Overall healthcare utilization decreased by 27 % in mothers and birthing parents seeking treatment for elevated levels of PPD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada - despite higher levels of PPD symptoms - highlighting the need to support and address barriers to postpartum care.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed by several systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses which provided contrasting and different results. We aimed to summarize the evidence relating to the global prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: An umbrella review of SRs and meta-analyses was performed. Searches were conducted in electronic databases up to April 2023. SRs and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic were selected for eligibility. Primary studies extracted from eligible meta-analyses were included in the quantitative synthesis. The research protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020173125). Results: A total of 25 SRs (198 primary studies) and 12 meta-analyses (129 primary studies) were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Studies involved data from five continents and 45 countries. The pooled prevalence of antenatal and postpartum depression was 29% (n = 55; 95% CI: 25%–33%) and 26% (n = 54; 95% CI: 23%–30%), respectively. In the case of anxiety, the pooled antenatal and postnatal prevalence was 31% (n = 44; 95% CI: 26%–37%; n = 16; 95% CI: 24%–39%). Differences emerged between continents, with Africa having the highest prevalence of perinatal depression and Oceania and Europe having the highest prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety. The prevalence also varied depending on the assessment tools, especially for antenatal anxiety. A medium-high quality of the studies was observed. One SR assessed strength-of-evidence, reporting very low strength. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, depression and anxiety were common, affecting almost one in three perinatal women globally. A high heterogeneity and a risk of publication bias were found, partially due to the variety of assessment tools and cut-offs. The results may not be generalized to minorities. Studies on the prevalence of clinical diagnoses are needed. Based on our results it is not possible to firmly affirm that the COVID-19 pandemic was the main factor that directly increased perinatal depression and anxiety during the past few years. Future studies should study other factors' impact.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic was a time of increased stress for families. Parents with a history of adversity may have been at higher risk of experiencing mental health problems during this time. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between pre-pandemic adversity pandemic related stressors and maternal mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Methods: Data was drawn from the Mothers' and Young People's Study (MYPS), a longitudinal of first time mothers and their children. Participants were 418 mothers who completed the MYPS COVID-19 sub-study. Data was collected during pregnancy, at 1, 4, 10 years postpartum, and during the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately 14 years postpartum). Path-analysis was used to test the relationship indirect relationship between pre-pandemic adversity and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms, via family functioning and pandemic related stress. Results: The hypothesised model was a good fit to the data accounting for 34 % and 33 % of the variance in maternal depressive and anxiety scores, respectively. A significant indirect effect was found between pre-pandemic adversity and both maternal anxiety and depressive systems via family relationships during the pandemic and pandemic related stress. Limitations: MYPS participants who took part in the COVID-19 sub-study were more likely to be older, have a higher level of education, and speak English as a first language, compared to the total MYPS sample. Conclusions: Family inclusive service responses which aim to strengthen family relationships may be particularly important for families where there is a history of adversity to support parental mental health.

N2  - Recurring Listeria outbreaks in the United States is a growing public healthcare concern. Although no associated reported death, 17 were hospitalized out of the 18 reported illnesses in the recent outbreak in 15 US states. The United States has experienced about 30 Listeria outbreaks in the last decade with 524 Listeriosis cases and 80 deaths. The identified origin were ice cream, leafy greens, mushroom, meat slice, dairy products like cheese, packaged salads, cooked chicken, hard-boiled egg, pork product, frozen vegetable, raw milk, packaged caramel apple, bean sprout and soya products. Although rare, Listeria may lead to serious illness (invasive listeriosis) or death. Listeriosis is critically harmful and medically complicated, especially in the pregnant, the old above 65 years and in the immunocompromised. It could cause premature birth, miscarriage or even neonatal death. Hospitalization is often necessary in the geriatric, being fatal at times. Among Listeria sp., Listeria monocytogenes is often human infection-associated. It is a gram-positive, non-sporulating, motile bacillus opportunistic pathogen. Food-borne listeriosis is often associated with frozen foods due to its ability to thrive at low temperatures. Hypervirulent strains of L. monocytogenes with an ability to infect the respiratory system (the lungs) was recently reported in the coronavirus disease-19 patients during the pandemic. L. monocytogenes seemed to have developed antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin and meropenem, possibly acquired through the food chain. An early onset of listeriosis in the newborn is evident in the first 7 days postparturition. As the bacteria colonize the genitourinary tract, majority of such cases result from teratogenic transfer during vaginal delivery. Premature newborns, neonates born outside healthcare facilities and low-birth-weight babies were increasingly predisposed to an early onset of listeriosis. Listeria outbreaks were earlier reported in South Africa, Australia and Europe, with an unclear origin of the outbreaks. Social media updates about such outbreaks, the most likely food source, and measures to self-protect are suggested as preventive measures. The article deals on various such aspects related to listeriosis primarily originating from food, to ensure better public healthcare and human wellness.

In 2019, Vaccine hesitancy was identified as one of the top 10 threats to global health by the World Health Organization. However, there remains a glaring scarcity of bibliometric research in that regard. This study sought to identify research hotspots and future development trends on influenza vaccine hesitation and provide a new perspective and reference for future research. Methods: We retrieved publications on global influenza vaccine hesitancy from the Web of Science Core Collection database, Scopus, and PubMed databases from inception to 2022. This study used VOSviewer and CiteSpace for visualization analysis. Results: Influenza vaccine hesitancy-related publications increased rapidly from 2012 and peaked in 2022. One hundred and nine countries contributed to influenza vaccine hesitation research, and the United States ranked first with 541 articles and 7161 citations. Vaccines-Basel was the journal with the largest number of published studies on influenza vaccine hesitations. MacDonald was the most frequently cited author. The most popular research topics on influenza vaccine hesitancy were (1) determinants of influenza vaccination in specific populations, such as healthcare workers, children, pregnant women, and so on; (2) influenza and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The trend in the number of annual publications related to influenza vaccine hesitancy indicating the COVID-19 pandemic will prompt researchers to increase their attention to influenza vaccine hesitancy. With healthcare workers as the key, reducing vaccine hesitancy and improving vaccine acceptance in high-risk groups will be the research direction in the next few years.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the levels of postnatal depression experienced by Arab women in Jordan and the United States (USA) and the impact of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: Participants were recruited through online survey links and social media channels, as well as face to face. A sample comprising 434 women in the postnatal period participated in the study that included Arab women in the USA and Jordan women, responding to a comprehensive questionnaire that encompassed inquiries about their pandemic status, demographic characteristics, postnatal depression, and social support. CES-D depression scale was used to determine the level of depression. Findings: The depression mean score among women in the postnatal period from Jordan was 24.90±4.14 and the depression mean score among Arab women in the USA was 27.70±4.49. The prevalence of depression among Jordanian women was 52.8% and the prevalence of depression among Arab American women was 73.0%. There is a significant difference between both groups in depression during the postnatal period with more prevalence among Arab American women (t=7.64, p=.010). There are no significant differences between groups in tangible and actual social support among both groups (t=1.50, p=.127). Conclusions: This nationwide study conducted among postnatal women in Jordan has shed light on several critical findings. Our study found that Arab women in the USA were suffering from more depression compared to Jordanian women. Moreover, our research highlighted a significant inverse relationship between social support and postnatal depression, indicating that as social support increased, levels of depression decreased among women in the postnatal period.

N2  - Background: In a historic move to ensure comprehensive abortion care, India amended the 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in 2021, creating an unprecedented opportunity for accelerating safe, respectful, and rights-based abortion services. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI), together with World Health Organization (WHO) India and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, set up a flagship initiative “Respectful Abortion Care” (RAC) to provide training to obstetricians and gynecologists on the new Act, and also address their values and biases. Methods: Virtual training sessions were organized during the COVID-19 pandemic to disseminate the amendments made under the MTP Act and address provider values and biases. The primary focus was on private providers as they account for more than half of all abortion services in India (52.9%). The RAC modules were systematically designed and delivered by 690 Master Trainers, trained by FOGSI and WHO. Results: A total of 9051 FOGSI members (22%, with 50% from private clinics) completed the RAC trainings. Pretests and post-tests were conducted for impact assessment. Significant improvement was seen on knowledge of criteria for termination of pregnancy for significant birth defects (52%–83%). The post-training survey showed a high level of commitment to promote RAC: >95% were strongly motivated to perform or assist in abortion; 89% reported that the WHO value clarification exercises were helpful in facilitating open discussions on sensitive topics in a comfortable manner; 96% expressed a strong commitment to addressing the issue of respect and confidentiality in abortion care. Conclusion: RAC was a unique initiative around the MTP Act amendment 2021 in India, which demonstrated that collaboration and leadership by professional associations can help motivate providers and lead to improved knowledge and commitment from public and private sector providers.

N2  - Problem: The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to have a detrimental impact on the mental health of pregnant individuals, and chronic stress can alter the immune profile. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the immune system in pregnancy are still poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the impact of pandemic exposure on the maternal immune profile in uncomplicated pregnancies. Method of study: We collected blood and placenta samples from pregnant individuals exposed and unexposed to the pandemic to compare their immune and inflammatory profiles. We performed co-culture with circulating maternal immune cells and endothelial cells to assess endothelial activation. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t-test, Mann-Whitney, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Results: In exposed individuals, we observed a decreased proportion of Th2 cells (p <.0001) and Treg/Th17 ratio (p <.05), as well as an increased Th1/Th2 ratio (p <.0001). Levels of IL-1β (p <.01) and IL-18 (p <.01) were increased in the circulation of exposed participants, whilst other mediators were significantly decreased (IFNγ, IL-8, MCP-1, amongst others). Furthermore, we observed increased production of ICAM, hallmark of endothelial activation, when we co-cultured endothelial cells with immune cells from exposed individuals. Vaccination status impacted the cellular profile with increased proportions of Th1 and B cells in vaccinated participants. Conclusion: Overall, we observed a pro-inflammatory bias in the circulation of pregnant individuals exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies. Our work also supports an association between the increased risk of endothelial activation/hypertension and SARS-CoV2 infection, which might be driven in part by exposure to the pandemic and associated stressors.

N2  - A 28-week supported online intervention for pregnant women, informed by the Behavior Change Wheel Framework, was developed. The intervention included exercises, group sessions and a peer support platform. The aim of this study was to examine the potential effectiveness of the intervention in enhancing resilience and promoting maternal mental health. Using a quasi-experimental design, assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention and follow-ups at six and 12 months after childbirth. Resilience, resilience attributes, and maternal mental health were measured using standardised scales. The intervention group received the intervention (N = 70), while the control group (N = 32) received care-as-usual. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine within- and between-group changes. Results showed no significant differences between groups regarding resilience and maternal mental health. However, the intervention group demonstrated stable resilience (p = 0.320) compared to a significant decrease in the control group (p = 0.004). Within the intervention group, perceived social support remained stable during the intervention, but decreased significantly at the first follow-up (p = 0.012). All participants faced additional stress from the COVID-19 pandemic alongside the challenges of parenthood. This study contributes to maternal mental health literature with an innovative, supported online intervention. The intervention consists of different deployable components, designed to be offered online, and the current pilot data are promising. Further research is warranted to explore its full potential in clinical practice.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) can interfere with the establishment of affective bonds between infant and mother, which is important for the cognitive, social–emotional, and physical development of the child. Rates of PPD have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to the added stress and limited support available to new parents. The present study examined whether parenting-related stress, perceived bonding impairments, the quality of observed mother–infant interactions, and salivary oxytocin levels differ between depressed and non-depressed mothers, along with differential impacts of COVID-19 on depressed mothers. Participants included 70 mothers (45 depressed, 25 controls) with infants aged 2–6 months. All data were collected remotely to ease participant burden during the pandemic. Depression was associated with experiences of heightened parenting-related stress and bonding difficulties. These differences were not observed during mother–infant interactions or in salivary oxytocin levels. Differences in COVID-19-related experiences were minimal, though depressed mothers rated slightly higher stress associated with returning to work and financial impacts of the pandemic. Findings highlight the importance of early intervention for PPD to mitigate long-term effects on mothers, children, and families. Additionally, they underscore the need for early intervention to support the developing mother–infant dyad relationship during this crucial time.

N2  - We studied T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 pregnant subjects at different gestational weeks who received three doses of mRNA-based vaccination to prevent COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools were used for T-cell recognition studies: peptides were 15 amino acids long and had previously been defined in COVID-19-convalescent subjects. T-cell activation was evaluated with the AIM assay. Most subjects showed coordinated, spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and the development of T cell memory. Non-spike-specific T cells in subjects who were not aware of previous COVID-19 infection suggested a prior undetected, asymptomatic infection. CD4- CD8- double negative (DN) T cells were numerous, of which a percentage was specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides. Regulatory T cells (Treg), both spike- and non-spike-specific, were also greatly expanded. Two Treg populations were defined: a population differentiated from naïve T cells, and pTreg, reverting from pro-inflammatory T cells. The Treg cells expressed CCR6, suggesting homing to the endometrium and vaginal epithelial cells. The pregnant women responded to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Asymptomatic COVID-19 was revealed by the T cell response to the non-spike peptides. The numerous DN T cells and Treg pointed our attention to new aspects of the adaptive immune response in vaccine recipients.

N2  - Objective: This study examined associations between participation in virtual support groups for peripartum women and mental health outcomes at follow-up approximately 8 months later. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey study assessed 383 women from the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) study. Initial participants (T1) were re-contacted (T2) and self-reported mental health symptoms of depression (CES-D), anxiety (GAD-7), and COVID-related grief were assessed at both time points. Participants reported involvement in virtual support groups and their perception of the effectiveness of social media in addressing feelings of loneliness. Results: The majority (62%) of respondents participated in a virtual support group, 99% of whom used informal social media-based groups (e.g. Facebook groups). At initial evaluation, virtual group participants reported higher levels of depressive symptoms (p=0.008) and COVID grief (p=0.004), but not higher levels of anxiety. Across the cohort, self-reported depressive, anxiety, and grief symptoms did not change significantly at follow-up in paired analysis, and virtual group participants did not demonstrate improvement in mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Participation in virtual support groups did not seem to improve mental health outcomes for peripartum women, and most women found social media engagement minimally effective at addressing loneliness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Targeted programs aimed at improving maternal mental health, particularly among those exposed to social determinants of health, are increasingly critical since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the impact of such programs is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a novel, language-concordant community-based program on perinatal mental health. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of peripartum individuals referred to a new community-based intervention known as Helping Us Grow Stronger (HUGS/Abrazos). Participants received up to 4 remote sessions with a cognitive behavioral therapy trained social worker, up to 3 resource navigation sessions with a community health worker, and direct relief with a grocery gift card and care package. Before and after the program, participants completed validated survey instruments to assess mental health and social determinants of health. RESULTS: A total of 178 participants were assessed after program completion, including 133 who were assessed before and after the program. The cohort was composed of 62.9% Hispanic or Latinx participants with a mean age of 29.8 year (standard error of mean, 0.46). There were high rates of food insecurity (111/178; 62.4%), experiences of discrimination (119/178; 66.9%), and SARS-CoV-2 infection (105/178; 59.0%). The program was associated with statistically significant improvements in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scores (baseline [mean±standard error of mean], 8.44±0.55 vs 6.77±0.51 after program completion; P=.0001) and Perceived Stress Scale scores (baseline, 15.2±0.74 vs 14.0±0.71; P=.035). Participants exposed to stressors including food insecurity and experiences of discrimination had higher baseline depression, stress, and anxiety scores. Those with experiences of discrimination, food insecurity, and SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy were more likely to have improvements in mental health scores postintervention. CONCLUSION: In this diverse urban cohort, a novel community-based intervention was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety, particularly among those with social determinants of health.

N2  - Background: Population-based estimates of syphilis prevalence are critical to informing public health response. We aimed to measure syphilis prevalence among Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Colombia to inform public health programming. Methods: Between July 2021 and February 2022, we surveyed 6221 adult Venezuelan refugees and migrants in four cities in Colombia using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Participants completed a survey and dual-rapid HIV/treponemal syphilis screening. Confirmatory laboratory-based rapid plasma reagin testing was conducted on whole blood samples. Active syphilis infection was defined as RPR titer ≥ 1:8 and no self-reported syphilis treatment. We used multivariable regression models to identify associations with active syphilis infection among subgroups by gender and history of pregnancy (cisgender men n = 2123, cisgender women n = 4044, transgender/nonbinary people n = 47, pregnant women n = 150). Findings: Population (RDS-weighted) prevalence of laboratory-confirmed syphilis was 5.1% (95% CI: 4.6–5.6). Syphilis prevalence was 5.8% (weighted) among men; lifetime sexually transmitted infections (STI) diagnosis, same-sex relationships, HIV infection, and partner number were independently associated with syphilis infection. Syphilis prevalence was 4.6% (weighted) in women; correlates of infection included: lifetime STI diagnosis, food insecurity, current engagement in sex work, current pregnancy, any unsafe night in Colombia, irregular migration status, and no healthcare utilization in Colombia. 14.9% (unweighted) of transgender participants had syphilis infection; correlates of infection included partner number and HIV infection. The prevalence of syphilis was 9.0% (weighted) among pregnant women, which was associated with lifetime STI diagnosis. Interpretation: Syphilis among Venezuelans in Colombia is high. Correlates of infection are distinct among demographic groups, spanning sexual and social vulnerabilities, suggesting tailored public health strategies. Funding:US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

N2  - Understanding interventions and their implementation is essential for improving community initiatives. Kidscope is a community paediatric development clinic providing free health and developmental assessment and onward referral for children aged zero to six years in an urban area of southern Ireland where many children experience complex needs. Established in 2010, Kidscope developed an inter-disciplinary, multi-agency community team by drawing on the strengths of local services and practitioners to deliver holistic approaches to child health and development. Recent studies examining stakeholder engagement and Kidscope outcomes highlighted the need to examine implementation to better understand the processes and mechanisms of the clinic and how events have affected outcomes. Methods Guided by the UK Medical Research Council Framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions, this study used a post-hoc qualitative process evaluation study design with multiple data sources; stakeholder perspectives (interviews, focus group, questionnaires) and document analysis (annual reports, meeting minutes, work plans). A diverse set of research questions were developed in conjunction with a Patient and Public Involvement Group. Guiding frameworks supported thematic analysis of primary data, document analysis of secondary data, and triangulation of findings across datasets. Results Data analysis yielded 17 themes and 18 sub-themes. Successful implementation hinged on developing a coalition of linked practitioners and services whose skills were utilised and enhanced within Kidscope to deliver a high-quality healthcare model to vulnerable children and families. Relational and multi-disciplinary working, innovative approaches to implementation and sustainability, training and education provision, and the accessible community location were among the mechanisms of change resulting in improved child, family, practitioner, and system-level outcomes. External factors such as COVID-19 and deficits in Ireland’s disability services posed significant barriers to fidelity. Conclusion This study provides evidence of the processes, mechanisms, and model of care employed by a community-based paediatric clinic to successfully engage society’s most vulnerable families and promote health equity. This study makes an important contribution to the field of implementation research by offering an example of a robust approach to conceptualising and measuring implementation outcomes of community healthcare initiative in a changing, real-world context.

N2  - The current reality of the diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection justifies a multidisciplinary and coordinated approach between Primary Care and Hospital Care, contemplating bidirectionality and communication between the two care settings. The consensus document, coordinated by the AIDS Study Group of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC-GeSIDA) and the Spanish Society of Family and Community Medicine (semFYC), was born out of this need. Here, the recommendations of the four sections that comprise it are summarized: the first deals with aspects of prevention and diagnosis of HIV infection; the second contemplates the clinical care of people living with HIV; the third deals with social factors, including legal and confidentiality issues, quality of life, and the role of NGOs; finally, the fourth block addresses bidirectional and shared training/teaching and research.

N2  - Background: Fatigue is common in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and can significantly impact quality of life. Melatonin, a safe inexpensive natural supplement, may improve symptoms and attenuate the side effects of RT. The purpose of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial was to assess the effects of melatonin for preventing fatigue and other symptoms in patients with breast cancer undergoing RT. Methods: Female early stage or Ductal carcinoma in situ patients with breast cancer ≥18 years of age with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <3, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, planned for outpatient RT treatment with curative intent, were randomized 1:1 to melatonin 20 mg or placebo, orally, starting the night before RT initiation until 2 weeks post-RT. Randomization was stratified according to treatment duration (<3 weeks, ≥3 weeks) and prior chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue scale), and secondary endpoints were FACIT-F subscales, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores obtained at baseline, and 2 and 8 weeks post-RT. A 2-sided ANOVA F-test at a 4.5% significance level for the primary endpoint was used. Secondary analyses were reported using an F-test at a 5% significance level. The goal was to recruit approximately 140 patients with interim analysis planned mid-recruitment. Results: Eighty-five patients were screened for eligibility; 79 patients were randomized: 40 to melatonin and 39 to placebo; 78 patients were treated and included in the interim analysis at the mid-recruitment point. Baseline patient characteristics of age, race, and ECOG performance status were similar in both arms. The treatment effect was studied using a longitudinal mixed effects model with the effect of treatment over time (treatment × time) as the primary outcome parameter. The treatment × time for FACIT-Fatigue did not demonstrate statistical significance (P-value .83) in the melatonin group compared to placebo. In addition, secondary analyses of FACIT physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being scores did not demonstrate statistical significance (P-values of .35, .06, .62, and .71, respectively). Total PROMIS scores, collected as secondary outcome reported by patients, did not demonstrate statistically significant change over time either (P-value is .34). The other secondary scale, ESAS, was analyzed for each individual item and found to be nonsignificant, anxiety (P = .56), well-being (.82), drowsiness (.83), lack of appetite (.35), nausea (.79), pain (.50), shortness of breath (.77), sleep (.45), and tiredness (.56). Depression was the only item demonstrating statistical significance with a decrease of 0.01 unit in the placebo group, a change not considered clinically significant. Melatonin was well-tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported. The most common side effects were headache, somnolence, and abdominal pain. No patients died while participating in this study. Two patients died within a year of study completion from breast cancer recurrence. Sixteen patients withdrew prior to study completion for various reasons including adverse events, hospitalizations unrelated to study drug, RT discontinuation, and COVID-19 precautions. Conclusions: In this double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial, melatonin did not prevent or significantly improve fatigue and other symptoms in patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing RT. The analysis, showing little evidence of an effect, at mid-recruitment, assured early termination of the trial.

N2  - Background: Females who experience hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have an increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk reduction follow-up after a patient has HDP. This study examined the experiences of patients with HDP who attended a specialized, longitudinal general internal medicine postpartum cardiovascular risk reduction clinic called PreVASC. PreVASC focuses on comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction through cardiovascular risk factor screening and management tailored specifically for female patients after they have HDP. Methods: This multimethod study examined the experiences of female patients with HDP via the following: (i) a quantitative survey (summarized with descriptive statistics); (ii) semistructured qualitative patient phone interviews (results grouped thematically); and (iii) triangulation of qualitative themes with quantitative survey results. Results: Overall, 37% of eligible clinic patients (42 of 115) participated; 79% of participants (n = 33) reported being “very satisfied” with the PreVASC clinic's specialized longitudinal model of care, and 95% (n = 40) reported making at least one preventive health behaviour change after receiving individualized counselling on cardiovascular risk reduction. Qualitative results found improvements in patient-reported cardiovascular health knowledge, health behaviours, and health-related anxiety. A preference for in-person vs phone clinic visits was reported by participants. Conclusions: An in-person, general internal medicine specialist–led, longitudinal model of cardiovascular disease preventive care focused specifically on cardiovascular risk reduction after HDP had positive impacts on patient experience, health knowledge, and preventive health behaviours. This novel knowledge on patient preferences for a longitudinal, specialized model of care advances cardiovascular risk reduction tailored specifically for high-risk people after HDP.

N2  - Introduction: Coronaviruses (CoVs) encompass a large group of viruses known to infect the upper respiratory tract in humans. The devastating impact of the virus has led to widespread infections among millions of individuals. Widespread disregard for ‘Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Appropriate Behaviour’ (CAB) by the public has significantly strained the Indian healthcare system. Despite efforts to educate the public on CAB through social media since 2020, only a minority have incorporated these practices into their daily lives. Notably, some vaccinated individuals have been hesitant to adhere to CAB despite repeated awareness efforts. This study aims to understand adherence to CAB among vaccinated and unvaccinated students not associated with the healthcare system. Aim: To evaluate the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of CAB among vaccinated and unvaccinated college students. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Sri Venkateshwaraa Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Puducherry, India among various engineering and arts college students of Puducherry, India from December 2021 to February 2022. A web-based data collection tool was designed using Google Forms. Data was collected through invitation letters and questionnaires distributed via WhatsApp groups and Instagram. The study included a total of 360 responses, with the questionnaire comprising 40 questions related to KAP, consisting of 17, 7, and 16 questions, respectively. The results were expressed in percentages. Results: Among the vaccinated participants, 263 (89.7%) identified social media as the primary source of COVID-19 related information. Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination revealed that over 50% were aware of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and the necessity of receiving two doses as advised by the government. While knowledge and attitude were similar across vaccinated and unvaccinated college students, there was a slightly higher percentage among the vaccinated group. However, there was an increased percentage of practice among unvaccinated students, indicating greater awareness of infection prevention. Conclusion: The study found that the knowledge, attitude, and behaviour of college students, particularly those not in medical fields, were satisfactory, likely due to the widespread availability of information on social media. These findings can be valuable for public health departments to adopt a people-centered approach to raise awareness among the public and reduce vaccine hesitancy.

N2  - Background and Aims: Pregnancy presents risks, particularly for women with pre-existing health problems. Pre-anaesthetic consultations can help anticipate these risks and establish a medical management strategy on the delivery day. While teleconsultations gained popularity during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, research on pre-anaesthetic teleconsultations during pregnancy is limited. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction and physician perception of teleconsultations for third-trimester pre-anaesthetic consultations. Methods: A prospective observational study included pregnant women who opted for teleconsultations for pre-anaesthetic consultations. Patient satisfaction was assessed using Likert scale questions and the System Use Scale. Anaesthetist satisfaction was evaluated using a Likert scale and by considering changes in anaesthetic techniques and missing clinical data in the pre-anaesthetic assessment. Data analysis utilised SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. encompassing descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing and odds ratio calculations. This approach explored the correlation between patient and anaesthetist satisfaction and pertinent risk factors. Results: The study enroled 99 patients, with 85% expressing satisfaction and high satisfaction on the Likert scale and 88% finding the teleconsultation acceptable based on the System Use Scale (score ≥ 70). Anaesthetists reported being satisfied with the pre-anaesthetic consultations in 94% of cases. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine consultations in obstetric anaesthesia, showing high patient and anaesthetist satisfaction rates.

N2  - Introduction: LatinX youth in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by HIV and STIs, commonly attributed to a lack of diagnostic testing and regular physician consultations to address sexual health. These disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This meta-analysis seeks to assess the efficacy of behavioral interventions among LatinX youth in the U.S. that aim to increase engagement in sexual health services (i.e., STI/HIV testing, physician consultations). Content: Following PRISMA guidelines, seven electronic databases were searched. We systematically extracted data with a coding form, and effect sizes were obtained from each study on HIV/STI testing outcomes and physician consultation. Moderator analyses were run for demographic and intervention characteristics. Summary and Outlook: Of nine included studies, the interventions created a small-to-moderate effect on increased engagement of sexual health services (d +=0.204, 95 CI=0.079, 0.329). Moderator analyses showed that interventions including the following characteristics were most efficacious at facilitating care services: community-based or online setting, access to diagnostic testing, social media/remote components, parental involvement, and longer session duration. This meta-analysis provides informative results regarding behavioral interventions that have proven efficacious in facilitating engagement in sexual health services among LatinX youth. Most prominently, interventions that are remote or through social media, community-based, and incorporated parents had large positive effects. These findings prove useful for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation and provide guidance for targeting LatinX youth to engage them in sexual health services as primary and secondary STI and HIV prevention.

N2  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted devastating effects on healthcare delivery systems, specifically those for pregnant women. The aim of this review was to determine the maternal perception of antenatal health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic critical phase. Methods Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE, and Ovid were systematically searched using the keywords “maternal”, “COVID-19 pandemic”, “maternal health service”, and “maternal perception”. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were original articles, written in English, and published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2022. This review was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eligible articles were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Thematic analysis was used for data synthesis. Results Of 2683 articles identified, 13 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the narrative synthesis. Five themes emerged regarding the determinants of maternal perception of antenatal healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic critical phase: lack of psychosocial support, poor maternal healthcare quality, poor opinion of virtual consultation, health structure adaptation failure to meet women's needs, and satisfaction with maternal health services. Conclusion Maternal perception, specifically pregnant women's psychosocial and maternal health needs, should be focused on the continuation of maternal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical to identify the maternal perception of maternal health services during the pandemic to ensure health service equity in the “new normal” future.

N2  - Introduction Timely access to maternity care is critical to saving lives. Digital health may serve to bridge the care chasm and advance health equity. Conducted in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional mixed-methods study assessed the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare facilities in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries to understand the landscape of ICT use in maternity care and the barriers and facilitators to its adoption. Materials and methods Between April 2021 and September 2022, we disseminated an online survey in English and Spanish among, mainly public, healthcare institutions that provided maternity care in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru. We also interviewed 27 administrators and providers in ministries of health and healthcare institutions. Results Most of the 1877 institutions that answered the survey reported using ICTs in maternity care (N = 1536, 82%), ranging from 96% in Peru to 64% in the Dominican Republic. Of institutions that used ICTs, 59% reported using them more than before or for the first time since the pandemic began. ICTs were most commonly used to provide family planning (64%) and breastfeeding (58%) counseling, mainly by phone (82%). At the facility level, availability of equipment and internet coverage, coupled with skilled human resources, were the main factors associated with ICT use. At country level, government-led initiatives to develop digital health platforms, alongside national investments in the digital infrastructure, were the determining factors in the adoption of ICTs in healthcare provision. Conclusion Digital health for maternity care provision relied on commonly available technology and did not necessitate highly sophisticated systems, making it a sustainable and replicable strategy. However, disparities in access to digital health remain and many facilities in rural and remote areas lacked connectivity. Use of ICTs in maternity care depended on countries’ long-term commitments to achieving universal health and digital coverage.

N2  - Background Pregnant women are among the most vulnerable and suffer the most during pandemics, according to earlier studies. Pregnant women had to seek healthcare for both themselves and their unborn child(ren) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was unprecedented. Pregnant women’s psychosocial experiences during pandemics are crucial since they both directly and indirectly affect the course of pregnancy and childbirth. The study therefore sought to explore the psychosocial experiences of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this retrospective qualitative study, 15 nursing mothers who were attending a postnatal clinic at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) hospital in Ghana were recruited. Individual interviews were conducted with mothers who were pregnant between March and December 2020. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed into themes. Results Nursing mothers were aged 25–30 years and had infants ranging from 5 months to 15 months. Thirteen (13) were married and two were single. Two (2) major themes and five (5) subthemes emerged from the study. The unpleasant feelings connected to the potential for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing stress were described by the theme, “Fear and Stress”. Participants’ social experiences (support from significant others), alterations in daily routine and the economic impact because of the pandemic were presented as the “Socioeconomic impact”. Conclusion Pregnant women go through several challenges during pregnancy such as perceived stress and anxiety. These are likely to heighten during a pandemic, as presented in the study. They therefore need emotional and psychosocial support in such uncertain times to improve outcomes of pregnancy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant and parenting women have low engagement and poor retention in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The aim of this study was to analyse the implementation of an adapted experience-based codesign (EBCD) process involving SUD treatment staff and pregnant or parenting women with lived experience (WWLE) of SUD to launch a residential treatment service where women could coreside with their children and receive long term comprehensive treatment for dual diagnosis of SUD and mental illness. METHODS: A process evaluation was conducted utilising five data sources: two sets of semistructured interviews with WWLE and SUD treatment staff, ethnographic observation and transcripts from group events, and meeting minutes. Based on the Integrated Promoting Action on Research in Health Services framework constructs (context, recipients, facilitation, innovation) researchers applied thematic analysis to determine main themes within each construct. RESULTS: The full sample across the implementation totalled 34 individuals (WWLE = 13 and SUD staff = 21). The EBCD process engaged both cohorts and supported group cohesion and collaborative brainstorming. WWLE felt respected, emotionally safe to share, and empowered by participation. A cohesive, multidisciplinary codesign planning group, inclusive of WWLE, supported a more equitable codesign process. The need for a virtual platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic impeded human connection and relationship building. The complex environment of residential regulations and uncertainties during start-up phase of an organisation presented implementation challenges. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the feasibility of, and challenges to, effectively engaging WWLE in a codesign process. The findings also demonstrated a positive influence on WWLE's feelings of empowerment. Identified themes reinforce the purposeful components within EBCD that enhance participation, along with new insights to inform successful codesign with a vulnerable population. The author's team included a WWLE who collaborated throughout the full scope of the research process, enriching the overall research and ensuring the authenticity of the presentation of women in recovery's perspective. Utilising the codesign approach to design and implement new services should improve health equity by enhancing patient engagement and retention in care. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Parenting WWLE of residential SUD treatment were involved in the full scope of the research process and the implementation being evaluated. For the actual codesign work WWLE were key members of the codesign planning team that met weekly throughout the implementation to plan, implement, problem solve and adapt the process over an 18 month timeframe. As is appropriate for codesign the actual ongoing workgroup participants had average 50% WWLE participation. For the research team, this research is a culmination of the lead author's doctoral dissertation. One member of the five-person dissertation committee was a recovery coach and a WWLE. She was an active participant across the entire research process overseeing and influencing the research design, conduct of the study, analysis, interpretation of findings and approval of the final manuscript. The findings were member checked with the larger codesign planning group that had additional WWLE members.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 disrupted health service delivery and weakened global and national health systems. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in health service utilization in three local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria and examine factors involved. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed-methods approach was used. A total of 315 pregnant women seen for antenatal care in 80 health facilities in three LGAs between October 1 and November 30, 2020, participated in exit interviews; 93 women participated in focus group discussions (FGDs). Descriptive analyses and a multivariable logistic analysis were conducted to examine associations between characteristics and decreased service utilization. Content analysis was used to identify the emerging themes related to health service utilization during the pandemic. RESULTS: One quarter of women reported that they reduced or ceased health service. The biggest reported changes were in immunization (47 to 30%, p < 0.001) and a small but statistically significant decline in antenatal care (98.7 to 93.8%, p < 0.001) was observed. Qualitative findings show that lockdowns, transportation issues, increased costs and fear of contracting COVID-19 or being labeled as COVID-positive were the most common reasons for not seeking care during this period of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic negatively impacted health service utilization amongst pregnant women in Nigeria. A better understanding of differences in state response could help inform future actions. The findings highlight the need for health systems to consider how to facilitate service utilization during a pandemic, such as providing safe transport or increasing outreach, and to minimize stigma for those seeking care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based home visiting programs are designed to improve maternal child health. Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a model evidence-based home visiting program, shown to improve pregnancy outcomes, child development, and economic self-sufficiency for first-time mothers and their families experiencing social and economic adversities, enrolling them early in pregnancy. Recently, NFP has expanded its services to multiparous women (previous live births) and enrolling women past 28 weeks gestation (late registrants) in selected agencies in Florida since 2021. OBJECTIVE: To study the process and impacts of expanding NFP to expanded populations (multiparous and/or late registrants), we convened a diverse Advisory Committee to guide the NFP expansion evaluation in Florida. METHODS: This study employed a modified e-Delphi method with three rounds of data collection, to engage diverse partners to identify process and impact outcomes for the NFP expansion evaluation. RESULTS: Child maltreatment was identified as the highest priority outcome. Process outcomes included program reach, client enrollment, and client engagement, while impact outcomes included maternal physical health, maternal mental health and substance use, birth outcomes, and breastfeeding practices. The Advisory Committee further identified potential data sources to measure these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Identifying and selecting key process and impact outcomes using a community-engaged process is necessary to ensure equal buy-in from all partners and to inform rigorous program evaluation. This study showed that using methods such as e-Delphi is feasible and effective for achieving thoughtful and rigorous decision-making, even in times of uncertainty like the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of an Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) group intervention on perceived stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms in women in the postpartum period. DESIGN: A one-group pre- and posttest quasi-experimental design. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: Postpartum depression (PPD) and anxiety affect nearly one in five women in the first 12 months after childbirth. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant worsening of symptoms of PPD, stress, and anxiety in this population. Mental health screening is the standard of care in perinatal settings. This practice has led to an increased rate of PPD and anxiety diagnoses and the need for evidence-based nonpharmacologic interventions to support mothers with PPD and anxiety. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven mothers seeking care for lactation concerns who screened positive for PPD and anxiety symptoms. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: A total of eight 1-hour group EFT sessions were offered to participants over a period of 4 weeks. During the group sessions, participants were taught how to perform the steps of EFT and apply it in a supportive group format. Measurement tools included the Subjective Unit of Distress Scale, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The preintervention and postintervention scores of these tools were compared using a paired-samples t test. RESULTS: After implementing EFT as a group intervention, we observed a reduction in mental health burden experienced by women in the postpartum period. There was a statistically significant decrease in depression (p = .003), anxiety (p <.001), and perceived stress (p <.001) scores 1 month after the EFT intervention. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EFT may be a viable adjunctive intervention for managing depression, anxiety, and stress in the postpartum period. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic was, and continues to be, uniquely experienced by women in the perinatal period and their families. Whilst long-term impacts of the pandemic are unknown, exposures in pregnancy and early life have impacts across the life-course and future generations. The objective of this manuscript was to explore how the pregnancy, postpartum and parenting experiences of a subset of participants from the 'BABY1000' cohort in Sydney, Australia, were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore associations between these experiences and state anxiety. METHODS: Mixed methods were used. Participants were requested to complete an online survey including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory short form (STAI-6), followed by an invitation to participate in focus group discussions (FGDs). RESULTS: From September to November 2021, 88 parents completed the survey (mean age 33.5 years, 60% born in Australia, 58% primiparous). Twenty-two parents participated in FGDs. Six themes were identified regarding the experience of parents: (1) Maternal support, (2) Family relationships, (3) Stress and mental health, (4) Healthcare, (5) Family lifestyle and routine, and (6) Long-term impacts. The mean STAI-6 score was 40 (SD 12.3), representing high anxiety. High anxiety was significantly associated with concern regarding COVID-19 and feeling overburdened and lonely. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health orders significantly impacted participants' pregnancy, postpartum and parenting experiences. Whilst these experiences included some unexpected positives, for many, these were outweighed by negative impacts on mental health, social support, health behaviours, and family relationships. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Ongoing longitudinal research is imperative to identify potential long-term effects of the pandemic across the life-course, better support families in the short and long-term, and plan for public health crises in the future.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on maternal mental health. We explored the lived experiences of women with perinatal depression and anxiety to elucidate their perceptions of how the pandemic influenced their mental health and access to care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. From March to October 2021, purposive sampling was used to recruit a socio-demographically diverse sample of women with self-reported perinatal depression or anxiety who were pregnant or within one year postpartum between March 2020 and October 2021. Interviews were conducted remotely and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Fourteen women were interviewed. Three major themes arose. Theme 1, Negative impacts of COVID-19 on symptoms of depression and anxiety, described how the pandemic magnified underlying symptoms of depression and anxiety, increased social isolation, generated anxiety due to fears of COVID-19 infection, and caused economic stress. In theme 2, Negative impacts of COVID-19 on access to and quality of health care, women described stressful and isolating delivery experiences, negative psychological impact of partners not being able to participate in their perinatal health care, interruptions and barriers to mental health treatment, and challenges in using telehealth services for mental health care. Theme 3, Positive impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, identified advantages of increased telehealth access and ability to work and study from home. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected women with perinatal depression and anxiety by magnifying underlying symptoms, increasing stress and social isolation, and disrupting access to mental health care. Findings provide support for policies and interventions to prevent and address social isolation, as well as optimization of telehealth services to prevent and address gaps in perinatal mental health treatment.

N2  - Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid changes to the delivery of maternal and newborn care. Our aim was to gain an understanding from parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) of how the pandemic and associated public health restrictions impacted the peripartum and postpartum experience, as well as longer-term health and well-being of families. Design Qualitative study through focus groups. Setting Ontario, Canada. Participants HCPs and parents who had a child born during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions Semistructured interview guide, with questions focused on how the pandemic impacted their care/their ability to provide care, and strategies to improve care and support now or in future situations with similar healthcare restrictions. Outcome measures Thematic analysis was used to describe participant experiences and recommendations. Results We included 11 HCPs and 15 parents in 6 focus groups. Participants described their experiences as 'traumatic', with difficulties in accessing prenatal and postpartum services, and feelings of distress and isolation. They also noted delays in speech and development in children born during the pandemic. Key recommendations included the provision of partner accompaniment throughout the course of care, expansion of available services for young families (particularly postpartum), and special considerations for marginalised groups, including access to technology for virtual care or the option of in-person visits. Conclusions Our findings may inform the development of healthcare system and organisational policies to ensure the provision of maternal and newborn care in the event of future public health emergencies. Of primary importance to the participants was the accommodation of antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum partner accompaniment, and the provision of postpartum services.

N2  - Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) aims at graduating from least developed country status by 2026 and must increase the level of domestic financing for health. This paper examines how the government has prepared for the decline of external assistance and how donors have applied their transition approaches. Adapting a World Health Organization (WHO) framework, reflections and lessons were generated based on literature review, informal and formal consultations and focus group discussions with the Lao PDR government and development partners including budget impact discussion. The government has taken three approaches to transition from external to domestic funding: mobilizing domestic resources, increasing efficiency across programs and prioritization with a focus on strengthening primary health care (PHC). The government has increased gradually domestic government health expenditures as a share of the government expenditure from 2.6% in 2013 to 4.9% in 2019. The Ministry of Health has made efforts to design and roll out integrated service delivery of maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services, immunization and nutrition; integrated 13 information systems of key health programs into one single District Health Information Software 2; and prioritized PHC, which has led to shifting donors towards supporting PHC. Donors have revisited their aid policies designed to improve sustainability and ownership of the government. However, the government faces challenges in improving cross-programmatic efficiency at the operational level and in further increasing the health budget due to the economic crisis aggravated during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Working to implement donor transition strategies under the current economic situation and country challenges, calls into question the criteria used to evaluate transition. This criterion needs to include more appropriate indicators other than gross national income per capita, which does not reflect a country's readiness and capacity of the health system. There should be a more country-tailored strategy and support for considering the context and system-wide readiness during donor transition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Improving family planning and maternal health outcomes are critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. While evidence on the effectiveness of government-driven public health programs is extensive, more research is needed on effectiveness of private-sector interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We evaluated the impacts of a commercial social-franchising and social-marketing program - Tiko Platform - which created a local ecosystem of health promoters, healthcare providers, pharmacies, stockists/wholesalers, and lifestyle shops. It provided economic incentives through discounts and reward points to nudge health-seeking behaviors from enrolled women consumers/beneficiaries. METHODS: An ex-post facto evaluation was commissioned, and we employed a quasi-experimental design to compare outcomes related to the use of family planning, and antenatal and postnatal services between users and non-users who had registered for Tiko in three North Indian cities. Between March and April 2021, 1514 married women were surveyed, and outcome indicators were constructed based on recall. Despite statistical approaches to control for confounding, the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on Tiko operations and methodological limitations preclude inferring causality or arguing generalizability. RESULTS: We found a strong association between the use of the Tiko platform and the current use of temporary modern contraceptives [non-users: 9.5%, effect: +9.4 percentage points (pp), p-value < 0.001], consumption of 100 or more iron-folic-acid tablets during pregnancy [non-users: 25.5%, effect: +14 pp, p-value < 0.001], receiving four or more antenatal check-ups [non-users: 18.3%, effect: +11.3 pp, p-value 0.007], and receiving postnatal check-up within six weeks of birth [non-users: 50.9%, effect: +7.5 pp, p-value 0.091]. No associations were found between the use of the Tiko platform and the current use of any type of contraceptive (temporary, permanent, or rudimentary). Effects were pronounced when a community health worker of the National Health Mission also worked as a health promoter for the Tiko Platform. CONCLUSION: Commercial interventions that harness market-driven approaches of incentives, social marketing, and social franchising improved family planning and maternal health practices through higher utilization of private market providers while maintaining access to government health services. Findings support a unifying approach to public health without separating government versus private services, but more rigorous and generalizable research is needed.

N2  - Objectives While issues in healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic have been widely discussed, little is known about health service issues from community (demand) sides. This study aimed to identify community needs in the utilisation of health services and highlight the key roles and barriers that community health workers (CHWs) face in delivering community-based services during the pandemic. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting 38 randomly selected villages covered by 21 preidentified community health centres in 3 districts in West Java, Indonesia. The survey was conducted from 22 January 2022 to 7 February 2022 (2 years after the pandemic began). Participants 118 respondents, consisting of community leaders, vulnerable group representatives and CHWs. Results Laboratory examination (55.1%), emergency care (52.5%), non-communicable disease screening (50%) and routine treatment (49.2%) were perceived as the highest unmet needs of essential healthcare services. Fear of infection (90.3%) became one main barrier to access healthcare services. Vulnerable populations including lowe socioeconomic groups (61.2%), households with elderly (25.4%), persons with disabilities (25.4%), pregnant women, people with mental illness and people with lower education (26.9%) were reported facing difficulties in accessing healthcare services. Further, the pandemic was deemed to have significantly impacted the community economic situation (91.5%). CHWs were actively engaged in community-based services and were mentioned as the first contact when the community needed help (57.6%). CHWs reported essential needs on financial support (45.2%), logistics (54.8%) and protective equipment (22.6%). Conclusions Essential health services for the community, including those belonging to vulnerable groups, were highly impacted during the pandemic. CHWs appear to have significant roles in delivering health services during this health crisis, hence, adequate support is needed to equip them in strengthening pandemic response.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance plays a vital role in informing public health decision-making. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused a widespread shift in public health priorities. Global efforts focused on COVID-19 monitoring and contact tracing. Existing public health programs were interrupted due to physical distancing measures and reallocation of resources. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic intersected with advancements in technologies that have the potential to support public health surveillance efforts. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore emergent public health surveillance methods during the early COVID-19 pandemic to characterize the impact of the pandemic on surveillance methods. METHODS: A scoping search was conducted in multiple databases and by scanning key government and public health organization websites from March 2020 to January 2022. Published papers and gray literature that described the application of new or revised approaches to public health surveillance were included. Papers that discussed the implications of novel public health surveillance approaches from ethical, legal, security, and equity perspectives were also included. The surveillance subject, method, location, and setting were extracted from each paper to identify trends in surveillance practices. Two public health epidemiologists were invited to provide their perspectives as peer reviewers. RESULTS: Of the 14,238 unique papers, a total of 241 papers describing novel surveillance methods and changes to surveillance methods are included. Eighty papers were review papers and 161 were single studies. Overall, the literature heavily featured papers detailing surveillance of COVID-19 transmission (n=187). Surveillance of other infectious diseases was also described, including other pathogens (n=12). Other public health topics included vaccines (n=9), mental health (n=11), substance use (n=4), healthy nutrition (n=1), maternal and child health (n=3), antimicrobial resistance (n=2), and misinformation (n=6). The literature was dominated by applications of digital surveillance, for example, by using big data through mobility tracking and infodemiology (n=163). Wastewater surveillance was also heavily represented (n=48). Other papers described adaptations to programs or methods that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=9). The scoping search also found 109 papers that discuss the ethical, legal, security, and equity implications of emerging surveillance methods. The peer reviewer public health epidemiologists noted that additional changes likely exist, beyond what has been reported and available for evidence syntheses. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated advancements in surveillance and the adoption of new technologies, especially for digital and wastewater surveillance methods. Given the investments in these systems, further applications for public health surveillance are likely. The literature for surveillance methods was dominated by surveillance of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. A substantial amount of literature on the ethical, legal, security, and equity implications of these emerging surveillance methods also points to a need for cautious consideration of potential harm.

N2  - While breastfeeding has long been an important, globally recognized aspect of population health, disparities exist across Canada. The Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI) is a WHO/UNICEF best-practice program that helps ensure families receive evidence-based perinatal care and is associated with improved breastfeeding rates. However, <10% of hospitals in Canada are designated as 'Baby-Friendly'. The Breastfeeding Committee for Canada (BCC) aimed to increase the number of hospitals that moved towards BFI designation by implementing a National BFI Quality Improvement Collaborative Project. Key activities included (1) implementing and evaluating the BFI Project with 25 hospital teams across Canada and (2) making recommendations for scaling up BFI in Canada. As of December 2023, three hospitals in the BFI Project have attained designation and six have started the official process towards designation with the BCC. Breastfeeding initiation rates remained high and stable (>80%); however, breastfeeding exclusivity rates did not meet targets. All BFI care indicators improved across participating facilities. All skin-to-skin indicators improved, with rates of immediate and sustained skin-to-skin meeting targets of >80% for vaginal births. BFI care indicators of documented assistance and support with breastfeeding within 6 hours of birth, rooming-in and education about community supports also met target levels. Leadership buy-in, parent partner engagement and collaborative activities of workshops, webinars and mentoring with BFI Project leadership were viewed as valuable. This BFI Project demonstrated that hospitals could successfully implement Baby-Friendly practices in various Canadian settings despite challenges introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators collected as part of this work demonstrate that delivery of Baby-Friendly care improved in participating facilities. Sustainability and scaling up BFI implementation in both hospitals and community health services across Canada through implementation of a BFI Coach Mentor Program is ongoing to enable continued progress and impact on breastfeeding and maternal-child health.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Access to family planning services is a human right that plays an essential role in society's health, particularly women's health. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of human life including access to family planning services. Accordingly, the main goal of this study was to explore the experiences of women and service providers from the main challenges and obstacles of access to family planning services and abortion services in Bangladesh, Iran, and the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this qualitative study, the data were collected through online, telephone, or in-person semi-structured interviews with key informants. Participants selected by purposive sampling method. The participants included women aged 15 to 49 (n = 63) and service providers (n = 54) in the 3 abovementioned countries. These individuals were included from October 2020 until December 2020. Conventional thematic analysis was employed to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The main extracted themes were challenges (reduction of referral; disruption of access to services; insufficient knowledge; worries among staff; rising prices; and unavailability of some contraceptives), measures (time extension and visit scheduling; telephone, online, and door to door services; and support of the media) and recommendations (health facility improvements; free, online, and closer services; and ongoing trainings and awareness campaigns). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected family planning and reproductive health services in different ways and has uncovered existing inequalities in access to these services. However, in Iran, the reported challenges were also rooted in new population policies that have further limited access to family planning and abortion services.

N2  - Social determinants of health (SDH) influence health and social outcomes in positive and negative ways. Understanding the impact of SDH on children with cerebral palsy (CP) is essential to improve health equity, optimize health outcomes, and support children with CP and their families to thrive in society. In this narrative review, we summarize the landscape of SDH impacting children with CP and their families worldwide. In high-income countries, children from poorer neighbourhoods are more likely to have severe comorbidities, present with spastic bilateral CP, and report lower frequency of participation in community activities. In low- and middle-income countries, socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with increased risk of malnutrition, living in poorer housing conditions, not having access to proper sanitation, and living below the poverty line. Low maternal education is associated with increased likelihood of the child with CP experiencing increased severity of gross motor and bimanual functioning challenges, and poorer academic performance. Lower parental education is also associated with reduced child autonomy. On the other hand, higher parental income is a protective factor, associated with greater diversity of participation in day-to-day activities. A better physical environment and better social support are associated with higher participation in daily activities. Clinicians, researchers, and the community should be aware of these key challenges and opportunities. Then adopt a range of approaches that target adverse SDH/social needs and foster positive SDH in the clinical setting. What this paper adds: Understanding how social determinants of health influence health and social outcomes is a critical step towards improving health equity and outcomes. Approaches are required that target the impact of adverse SDH on access to health care for children with cerebral palsy and that work towards ensuring equity of access for all.

N2  - Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy causes adverse outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. Neonates are at risk of vertical transmission and in-utero infection. Additionally, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and impairment in the organ systems of the mother are associated with neonatal outcomes, including impaired intrauterine growth, prematurity, and neonatal ICU admission. The management of neonates born from infected mothers has changed over the progress of the pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, cesarean section, immediate separation of mother-infant dyads, isolation of neonates, and avoiding of skin-to-skin contact, breast milk, and breastfeeding were the main practices to reduce vertical and horizontal transmission risk in the era of insufficient knowledge. The effects of antenatal steroids and delayed cord clamping on COVID-19 were also not known. As the pandemic progressed, data showed that prenatal, delivery room, and postnatal care of neonates can be performed as pre-pandemic practices. Variants and vaccines that affect clinical course and outcomes have emerged during the pandemic. The severity of the disease and the timing of infection in pregnancy also influence maternal and neonatal outcomes. The knowledge and lessons from COVID-19 will be helpful for the next pandemic if it happens. Impact: Prenatal infection with COVID-19 is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.Our review includes the management of neonates with prenatal COVID-19 infection exposure, maternal-fetal, delivery room, and postnatal care of neonates, clinical features, treatment of neonates, and influencing factors such as variants, vaccination, severity of maternal disease, and timing of infection during pregnancy.There is a growing body of data and evidence about the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge and lessons from the pandemic will be helpful for the next pandemic if it happens.

N2  - Aim: The concept of regaining childbearing ability via uterus transplantation (UTx) motivates many infertile women to pursue giving birth to their own children. This article provides insight into maternal and neonatal outcomes of the procedure globally and facilitates quality of care in related medical fields. Methods: The authors searched ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE, non-PubMed-indexed journals, and common search engines to identify peer-review publications and unpublished sources in scientific reference databases. Results: The feasibility of the procedure has been proven with 46 healthy children in 88 procedures so far. Success relies upon dedicated teamwork involving transplantation surgery, obstetrics and reproductive medicine, neonatology, pediatrics, psychology, and bioethics. However, challenges exist owing to donor, recipient, and fetus. Fetal growth in genetically foreign uterine allograft with altered feto-maternal interface and vascular anatomy, immunosuppressive exposure, lack of graft innervation leading to “unable-to-feel” uterine contractions and conception via assisted reproductive technology create notable risks during pregnancy. Significant portion of women are complicated by at least one or more obstetric problems. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and diabetes mellitus, elevated kidney indices, and preterm delivery are common complications. Conclusions: UTx has short- and long-term satisfying outcome. Advancements in the post-transplant management would undoubtedly lead this experimental procedure into mainstream clinical practice in the near future. However, both women and children of UTx need special consideration due to prematurity-related neonatal problems and the long-term effects of transplant pregnancy. Notable health risks for the recipient and fetus should be discussed with potential candidates for UTx.

N2  - Clinical practices vary significantly between countries, so healthcare providers must be aware of the differences in recommendations among guidelines to give the best care possible. It is up to the clinician to decide whether and to what extent to follow guidelines, based on each patient's special situation. This study aimed to review the updated evidence regarding practical aspects required for midwives to do postpartum care for mothers and newborns during COVID-19. The relevant guidelines in English were searched through databases including Cochrane Library, PubMed, EBSCO, and Sco-pus, from December 2019 to May 17, 2022, using keywords of ‘puerperium ‘, ‘newborn ‘, ‘2019-nCoV’ ‘SARS-CoV-2‘, ‘coronavirus ‘, and ‘guideline‘. Recommendation reports of WHO, FIGO, RCOG, UNFPA, CDC, and APA were also searched. Out of the 40 guidelines retrieved, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Postnatal care is divided into two general categories: maternal and neonatal care. The principles of postpartum care for maternal consisted of maternal assessment, venous thromboem-bolism prophylaxis, postnatal visits schedule, visitor restriction, vaccination, and postnatal mental support. Also, care for the neonatal included newborn assessment, visitation in the neonatal intensive-care units, breastfeeding, vaccination, circumcision, the decision for location and the separation of the newborn and mother, and discharge. During the COVID-19 pandemic, midwives and other maternal care professionals faced issues due to discrepancies between the guidelines of various global organizations. By obtaining recommendations and guidance and keeping up with the latest data, midwives can help women and their newborns get the best care possible.

N2  - Background: Little is known about participation during adverse times. Objectives: This study described participation of children with autism aged 6 to 13 during COVID-19 pandemic and examined the extent to which child factors, mother’s own participation, and environmental barriers/supports explain child participation in home and community. Method: A total of 130 mothers completed the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth, the Health Promoting Activities Scale, functional issues checklist, and sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: Children’s participation frequency and involvement were significantly higher at home than in the community. In both settings, mothers desired change in 71% of activities. Multiple regression models indicated that child’s age and mother’s participation frequency significantly explained child’s home involvement (R2 = 21%), where mother’s participation (frequency) had a unique contribution (ΔR2 = 10.4%) at home but not in the community. Conclusion: Findings imply the importance of maternal participation to child’s participation at home and suggest redirecting attention for enhancing family participation as a whole.

N2  - Pregnant and postnatal women are a high-risk population particularly prone to rapid progression to sepsis with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Moreover, severe maternal infections can have a serious detrimental impact on neonates with almost 1 million neonatal deaths annually attributed to maternal infection or sepsis. In this review we discuss the susceptibility of pregnant women and their specific physiological and immunological adaptations that contribute to their vulnerability to sepsis, the implications for the neonate, as well as the issues with antimicrobial stewardship and the challenges this poses when attempting to reach a balance between clinical care and urgent treatment. Finally, we review advancements in the development of pregnancy-specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and how these can be used to optimize the care of pregnant women and neonates.

N2  - This case highlights the treatment strategies for ALK-positive non–small-cell lung cancer in pregnant females, where only scarce experience is available yet. Our case also implies that patients in the postpartum period are particularly vulnerable to complications, in our case pneumonitis and globus pallidus necrosis, the latter of which has not been reported previously. • Thus, our case raises the awareness of potential complications and highlights the need for close follow-up during ALK-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment in the postpartum period. • Finally, our case demonstrates that brigatinib is a viable option in patients with an antecedent severe pneumonitis induced by a different ALK inhibitor.

N2  - At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kenya Ministry of Health instituted movement cessation measures and limits on face-to-face meetings. We explore the ways in which female sex workers (FSWs) in Nairobi were affected by the COVID-19 control measures and the ways they coped with the hardships. Forty-seven women were randomly sampled from the Maisha Fiti study, a longitudinal study of 1003 FSWs accessing sexual reproductive health services in Nairobi for an in-depth qualitative interview 4–5 months into the pandemic. We sought to understand the effects of COVID-19 on their lives. Data were transcribed, translated, and coded inductively. The COVID-19 measures disenfranchised FSWs reducing access to healthcare, decreasing income and increasing sexual, physical, and financial abuse by clients and law enforcement. Due to the customer-facing nature of their work, sex workers were hit hard by the COVID-19 restrictions. FSWs experienced poor mental health and strained interpersonal relationships. To cope they skipped meals, reduced alcohol use and smoking, started small businesses to supplement sex work or relocated to their rural homes. Interventions that ensure continuity of access to health services, prevent exploitation, and ensure the social and economic protection of FSWs during times of economic strain are required.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the experiences of midwives working in the maternity ward during the COVID-19 pandemic by SWOT analysis. Materials and Methods: A descriptive qualitative study reported following the COREQ guidelines. For the purposes of this study, 40 midwives working in the delivery room throughout the pandemic were interviewed. Research data were collected using a Personal Information Form (PIF) and a SWOT analysis interview form. One-on-one and in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with the midwives. All interviews were recorded with the consent of the midwives. Collected data were transcribed and a content analysis was carried out using the MAQDA 2020 program. Results: Data collected in the study were categorized under four main themes as “Strengths”, “Weaknesses”, “Opportunities” and “Threats”. Conclusion: Midwives worked under difficult conditions during pandemi, so they were extremely tired and worn out. Midwives who could not go home during this difficult period gave psychological warfare because they were separated from their families. In addition, they thought that they could not provide adequate care and support to pregnant women at the time of delivery within the framework of social distance protection measures. This made them feel professionally inadequate.

N2  - Background: The acceptance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination by the community was largely affected by information or misinformation spreading through various channels. Hence, in the process of deploying vaccines, it became important to explore the community’s knowledge and attitude toward such intervention. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 vaccination among the general population of Kolkata and to compare knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 vaccination among different groups based on age, gender, socioeconomic status, educational qualifications, and occupation. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out with 389 participants among the patients attending general outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Kolkata using a pre-tested questionnaire having sections on knowledge, attitude, and practices toward COVID-19 vaccination. Knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were then calculated and compared among different groups based on age, gender, socioeconomic status, educational qualifications, occupation, and history of COVID-19 infection. Results: Knowledge was found to differ significantly with respect to education, occupation, socioeconomic status, and history of COVID-19 infection. Attitude showed no variation to these variables, while practice scores were found to be significantly associated with education, socioeconomic status, and history of COVID-19 infection. The unavailability of slots for vaccination was not the reason for anyone remaining unvaccinated. Financial reasons were one of the factors determining vaccine hesitancy in parts of the world before vaccines were available. This study found that 72.8% of participants found vaccines to be inexpensive. Of the participants not having received even a single dose of vaccine, the most common reason was pregnancy and lactation-related issues. Conclusion: The reason behind such associations can be further explored in bigger multicentric studies. Improvement studies may also be carried out to assess the effectiveness of various channels of communication which may aid in figuring out lacunae and planning of similar vaccination drives in the future.

N2  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required numerous measures in hospitals as well as in medical and midwife practices within a very short time in order to provide continuous medical care for pregnant women infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and at the same time, to protect healthy pregnant women and medical personnel from the infection. For hospitalized patients the focus was on structural and hygiene adaptations, while in the outpatient setting, telehealth services were often established for pregnant and postpartum women. As the disease entails major risks for both the mother and the fetus with increasing gestational age, vaccination is strongly recommended for women planning to have a child as well as for pregnant women. The therapeutic options are principally comparable to those for non-pregnant women, include corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies in addition to virostatic drugs, and are continuously adapted to the latest findings. The impact of the pandemic on medical personnel is not yet fully foreseeable.

N2  - This prospective cohort study investigated the mobility patterns of 200 pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV in South Africa. Participants were enrolled during their third trimester from routine antenatal care near Cape Town, South Africa, and followed for six months postpartum. Quantitative data were collected at enrollment and follow-up. Mobility (self-reported) was common among the participants, despite the brief study period and the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. While most reported stability in their current residence, 71% had a second main residence, primarily in the Eastern Cape (EC). Participants had a median of two lifetime moves, motivated by work, education, and family life. During the study period, 20% of participants met the study definition of travel (>7 days and >50 km), with trips predominantly to the EC, lasting a median duration of 30 days. Over one-third of participants with other living children reported that these children lived apart from them, with the mother’s family being primary caregivers. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to support continuity of care for mobile populations, particularly peripartum women living with HIV. The study contributes valuable insights into mobility dynamics and highlights unique barriers faced by this population, contributing to improved HIV care in resource-limited settings.

N2  - Health behaviours of pregnant women should promote an optimal course of pregnancy and maternal health. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women’s health behaviours (proper eating habits with a particular focus on the type of food consumed; preventive behaviours in terms of compliance with health recommendations and obtaining information on health and disease; healthy practices—daily habits in terms of sleep, rest and physical activity; as well as positive mental attitudes—avoiding strong emotions, stress, and depressing situations, determined by the frequency of each behaviour reported by the respondents). The study included women at different stages of pregnancy and women who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 355 women participated in the study. The study used a proprietary questionnaire and the Health Behaviour Inventory (HBI). The overall health behaviour score during the pandemic was higher (85.87) than the pre-pandemic score (82.16). There was a statistically significant difference between the total pre-pandemic and during-pandemic HBI scores. Additionally, there was an increase in the total score in each of the health behaviour domains during the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic results. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women presented a statistically significantly higher rate of health behaviours, as measured with the HBI, indicating that respondents were more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours. The study has shown a positive change in pregnant women’s eating habits, which can potentially affect the health of the population in the future.

N2  - Introduction: Pandemics like COVID-19 has strained healthcare systems globally, particularly in resource-limited settings where pre-existing healthcare gaps and constraints amplify the challenges faced by pregnant women. Having this lesson on pregnant women’s experiences during COVID-19 offers invaluable insights into potential strategies and interventions needed to mitigate the impact of similar outbreaks in the future. Therefore, this phenomenological study aimed to uncover the experiences of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Dilla town, Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia. Method and Materials: A descriptive phenomenological design was employed at Dilla University teaching hospital. A Purposive sampling technique was used and point of data saturation was declared at participant 16th. An in-depth interview was conducted in a private room after they received antenatal care services. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analysed using the open code software version 4.03. The interviews were transcribed verbatim to provide tick descriptions of data. Thematic analysis was employed using an inductive approach. Direct quotes from participants were included without any grammar editing to preserve their intended meaning. Results: Our study found five predominant themes: mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, health impact of COVID-19, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 influence on social engagements, and challenge on getting reliable information. Conclusion and Recommendation: This study identified that pregnant women experienced various challenges during the pandemic which includes psychological problems, health impact of COVID-19, economic problems, lack of reliable information and limited social support. Hence, implementing a customized approach by integrating psychosocial interventions with prenatal care services and conducting intensive health education sessions and economic empowerment are beneficial as mitigation strategies to better prepare for future pandemics.

N2  - Purpose: Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the impact of negative patient outcomes on healthcare providers. In Ghana, obstetric providers regularly face maternal and neonatal mortality, yet limited research has focused on provision of mental health support for these providers. This study sought to understand how obstetric providers viewed seeking mental health support after poor clinical outcomes, with a focus on the role of mental health stigma. Patients and Methods: Participants were 52 obstetric providers (20 obstetrician/gynecologists and 32 midwives) at two tertiary care hospitals in Ghana. Five focus groups, led by a trained facilitator and lasting approximately two hours, were conducted to explore provider experiences and perceptions of support following poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, then analyzed qualitatively using grounded theory methodology. Results: Most participants (84.3%, N=43) were finished with training, and 46.2% (N=24) had been in practice more than 10 years. Emerging themes included pervasive stigma associated with seeking mental health care after experiencing poor clinical outcomes, which was derived from two overlapping dimensions. First, societal-level stigma resulted from a cultural norm to keep emotions hidden, and the perception that psychiatry is equated with severe mental illness. Second, provider-level stigma resulted from the belief that healthcare workers should not have mental health problems, a perception that mental health care is acceptable for patients but not for providers, and a fear about lack of confidentiality. Despite many providers acknowledging negative mental health impacts following poor clinical outcomes, these additive layers of stigma limited their willingness to engage in formal mental health care. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that stigma creates significant barriers to acceptance of mental health support among obstetric providers. Interventions to support providers will need to respect provider concerns without reinforcing the stigma associated with seeking mental health care.

N2  - Key content: The use of telemedicine in obstetrics and gynaecology clinical practice increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article presents a framework to ensure training opportunities continue during telemedicine consultations, allowing trainees to develop their skills within the framework of telemedicine to optimise consultations and safe clinical practice. Remote teaching offers several advantages and disadvantages over face-to-face teaching. The value of each teaching method needs to be considered for the specific setting and the content tailored accordingly. Hybrid delivery is an option now that the infrastructure is in place. Telementoring includes remote supervision of clinics and expert review of, for example, colposcopy and ultrasound images. The technology is available for live-stream remote supervision of ultrasound and surgery, allowing expert input out of hours or in geographically isolated areas. Telesimulation training can occur remotely and offers the possibility of remote assessment with artificial intelligence. The use of simulation technology may facilitate the standardisation of practical skills assessment in obstetrics and gynaecology. Learning objectives: To consider a framework to ensure training opportunities and safe clinical practice during telemedicine consultations. To understand the range of remote training modalities available to improve accessibility to practical skills training and wider access to theoretical knowledge. Ethical issues: How can we provide adequate supervision during telemedicine and is there an effect on patient safety? How can trainers and trainees optimise continuing postgraduate learning opportunities as telemedicine and telementoring are established in mainstream clinical practice?.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which became a global public health crisis. In the past 3 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic increase in the occurrence of psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and stress in global populations. Therefore, it is important to help pregnant women cope with major public emergencies and improve their physical and mental health. Objective: To investigate the status and influencing factors of anxiety, insomnia, and psychological stress disorder in pregnant women with COVID-19 to provide a theoretical basis for psychological intervention in pregnant women in the case of public health emergency events. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 435 pregnant women from multiple tertiary hospitals in Zhengzhou from November 6 to December 6, 2022. The questionnaire contents included the general information of pregnant women, insomnia scale, generalized anxiety scale, and the revised version of the Accident Impact Scale. Results: There are 251 pregnant women with anxiety (57.7%, 95% CI: (53.0%-62.4%).There are 166 pregnant women with insomnia. (38.2%, 95% CI: 33.6%-42.7%), There are 314 pregnant women with stress disorder.(72.2%, 95% CI: 68.0%–76.4%). During the epidemic prevention and control period, whether pregnant women had a history of adverse pregnancy had a statistically significant difference in anxiety, insomnia and stress disorders. Conclusion and Recommendation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women appeared to generally have anxiety, insomnia, and stress disorders. Poor pregnancy history is a protective factor for pregnant women with anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In the case of similar public health emergencies, attention bias modification (ABM) may be a potential intervention measure to provide potentially new ideas for alleviating the psychological disorders of pregnant women during this special period.

N2  - Background: The United Nations has declared that humans have a right to clean air. Despite this, many deaths and disability-adjusted life years are attributed to air pollution exposure each year. We face both challenges to air quality and opportunities to improve, but several areas need to be addressed with urgency. Objective: This paper summarises the recent research presented at the Pacific Basin Consortium for Environment and Health Symposium and focuses on three key areas of air pollution that are important to human health and require more research. Findings and conclusion: Indoor spaces are commonly places of exposure to poor air quality and are difficult to monitor and regulate. Global climate change risks worsening air quality in a bi-directional fashion. The rising use of electric vehicles may offer opportunities to improve air quality, but it also presents new challenges. Government policies and initiatives could lead to improved air and environmental justice. Several populations, such as older people and children, face increased harm from air pollution and should become priority groups for action.

N2  - Multiple sclerosis is an important neurological disease affecting millions of young patients globally. It is encouraging that more than ten disease-modifying drugs became available for use in the past two decades. These disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have different levels of efficacy, routes of administration, adverse effect profiles and concerns for pregnancy. Much knowledge and caution are needed for their appropriate use in MS patients who are heterogeneous in clinical features and severity, lesion load on magnetic resonance imaging and response to DMT. We aim for an updated review of the concept of personalization in the use of DMT for relapsing MS patients. Shared decision making with consideration for the preference and expectation of patients who understand the potential efficacy/benefits and risks of DMT is advocated.

N2  - Mass vaccination against COVID-19 is the best method to ensure herd immunity in order to curb the effect of the pandemic on the global economy. It is therefore important to assess the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy on a global scale. Factors were recorded from cross-sectional studies analyzed with t-Test, ANOVA, correlation, and meta-regression analyses and synthesized to identify global trends in order to inform policy. We registered the protocol (ID: CRD42022350418) and used standard Cochrane methods and PRISMA guidelines to collect and synthesize cross-sectional articles published between January 2020 and August 2023. A total of 67 articles with 576 studies from 185 countries involving 3081,766 participants were included in this synthesis. Global COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was 65.27% (95% CI; 62.72–67.84%), while global vaccine hesitancy stood at 32.1% (95% CI; 29.05–35.17%). One-Way ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference in the percentage Gross Domestic Product spent on vaccine procurement across the World Bank income levels (p < 0.187). There was a significant difference of vaccine acceptance (p < 0.001) and vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.005) across the different World Bank Income levels. World Bank income level had a strong influence on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (p < 0.0004) and hesitancy (p < 0.003) but percentage Gross Domestic Product spent on vaccine procurement did not. There was no correlation between percentage Gross Domestic Product spent on vaccine procurement and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (r = −0.11, p < 0.164) or vaccine hesitancy (r = −0.09, p < 0.234). Meta-regression analysis showed that living in an urban setting (OR = 4.83, 95% CI; 0.67–212.8), rural setting (OR = 2.53, 95% CI; 0.29–119.33), older (OR = 1.98, 95% CI; 0.99–4.07), higher education (OR = 1.76, 95% CI; 0.85–3.81), and being a low income earner (OR = 2.85, 95% CI; 0.45–30.63) increased the odds of high COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Factors that increased the odds of high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were no influenza vaccine (OR = 33.06, 95% CI; 5.03–1395.01), mistrust for vaccines (OR = 3.91, 95% CI; 1.92–8.24), complacency (OR = 2.86, 95% CI; 1.02–8.83), pregnancy (OR = 2.3, 95% CI; 0.12–141.76), taking traditional herbs (OR = 2.15, 95% CI; 0.52–10.42), being female (OR = 1.53, 95% CI; 0.78–3.01), and safety concerns (OR = 1.29, 95% CI; 0.67–2.51). We proposed a number of recommendations to increase vaccine acceptance and ensure global herd immunity against COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a wave of anxiety and stress in all segments of society, especially among pregnant women. Stress poses a significant health concern for pregnant women, potentially impacting maternal and fetal well-being. Aim: This study aims to explore the relationship between COVID-19 stress in pregnant women and the mode of delivery, APGAR score, and anthropometric indices of newborns. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021, employing a survey method on 195 pregnant women who sought delivery at 22 Bahman Hospital in Khaf. Data collection involved the use of the standard COVID Stress Scale (CSS). SPSS-22 software was utilized for the analysis, employing Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression tests at a significance level of 0.05. Results: Pregnant women who underwent cesarean sections exhibited significantly higher levels of COVID-19-related stress compared to those who had natural deliveries (p<0.001). A significant negative correlation was observed between the APGAR scores in the first and fifth minutes and the anthropometric indices (weight, length, and head circumference) of newborns concerning COVID-19 stress (p<0.001). Moreover, maternal stress emerged as a predictor for the type of delivery, APGAR scores, length, and head circumference of newborns (p<0.001). Conclusion: The study underscores the adverse impact of COVID-19 stress on maternal pregnancy outcomes, particularly leading to elevated cesarean section rates. The substantial influence of this stress on the APGAR score and anthropometric indices of newborns highlights the significance of implementing screening, counseling, and stress reduction education for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

N2  - Childhood obesity is a complex disease with multiple biological and psychosocial risk factors. Recently, novel digital programs were developed with growing evidence for their effectiveness in pediatric weight management studies. The ENDORSE platform consists of mobile applications, wearables, and serious games for the remote management of childhood obesity. The pilot studies included 50 mothers and their children aged 6–14 years and resulted in a clinically significant BMI z-score reduction over 4 to 5 months. This secondary analysis of the ENDORSE study focuses on parenting styles and psychosocial factors. Methodology: Semi-structured clinical interviews were conducted with all participating mothers pre-and post-intervention. The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) evaluated the mothers’ parenting styles. The psychosocial functioning of the participating children was assessed with the parental version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The relationship between parenting styles, psychosocial parameters, and weight outcomes was investigated using a linear regression analysis. Results: Weight-related stigma at school (56%), body image concerns (66%), and difficulties in family relationships (48%) were the main concerns documented during the initial psychological interviews. According to the SDQ, there was a significant decrease in children’s conduct problems during the study’s initial phase (pre-pilot group). A decrease in maternal demandingness (i.e., strict parenting style) was associated with a decrease in BMI z-score (beta coefficient = 0.314, p-value = 0.003). Conclusion: Decreasing parental demandingness was associated with better weight outcomes, highlighting the importance of assessing parenting factors in pediatric weight management programs.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased number of out-of-hospital births in the United States and other nations. While many studies have sought to understand the experiences of pregnant and birthing people during this time, few have compared experiences across birth locations. Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the narratives and decision-making processes of those who gave birth in and out of hospitals during the pandemic. Design: We conducted semi-structured narrative interviews with 24 women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Interviews were transcribed and coded, and a thematic narrative analysis was employed. Final themes and exemplary quotes were determined in discussion among the research team. Results: Results from narrative analysis revealed three themes that played into participants’ birth location decisions: (1) birth efficacy and values, (2) diverse definitions of safety, and (3) childcare and other logistics. In each of these themes, participants who gave birth in birthing centers, at the hospital, and at home describe their individualized approach to achieving a supportive birth environment while mitigating the risk of labor complications and COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Our study suggests that for some childbearing people, the pandemic did not change birthing values or decisions but rather brought enhanced clarity to their individual needs during birth and perceived risks, benefits, and limitations of each birthing space. This study further highlights the need for improved structural support for birthing people to access a range of safe and supportive birthing environments.

N2  - Background: Healthcare-associated infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. In adults, data suggest the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract may reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract has not been evaluated in the paediatric intensive care unit population. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of conducting a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial in critically ill children comparing selective decontamination of the digestive tract with standard infection control. Design: Parallel-group pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial with an integrated mixed-methods study. Setting: Six paediatric intensive care units in England. Participants: Children (> 37 weeks corrected gestational age, up to 16 years) requiring mechanical ventilation expected to last for at least 48 hours were eligible for the PICnIC pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial. During the ecology periods, all children admitted to the paediatric intensive care units were eligible. Parents/legal guardians of recruited patients and healthcare professionals working in paediatric intensive care units were eligible for inclusion in the mixed-methods study. Interventions: The interventions in the PICnIC pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial included administration of selective decontamination of the digestive tract as oro-pharyngeal paste and as a suspension given by enteric tube during the period of mechanical ventilation. Main outcome measures: The decision as to whether a definitive cluster-randomised controlled trial is feasible is based on multiple outcomes, including (but not limited to): (1) willingness and ability to recruit eligible patients; (2) adherence to the selective decontamination of the digestive tract intervention; (3) acceptability of the definitive cluster-randomised controlled trial; (4) estimation of recruitment rate; and (5) understanding of potential clinical and ecological outcome measures. Results: A total of 368 children (85% of all those who were eligible) were enrolled in the PICnIC pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial across six paediatric intensive care units: 207 in the baseline phase (Period One) and 161 in the intervention period (Period Two). In sites delivering selective decontamination of the digestive tract, the majority (98%) of children received at least one dose of selective decontamination of the digestive tract, and of these, 68% commenced within the first 6 hours. Consent for the collection of additional swabs was low (44%), though data completeness for potential outcomes, including microbiology data from routine clinical swab testing, was excellent. Recruited children were representative of the wider paediatric intensive care unit population. Overall, 3.6 children/site/week were recruited compared with the potential recruitment rate for a definitive cluster-randomised controlled trial of 3 children/site/week, based on data from all UK paediatric intensive care units. The proposed trial, including consent and selective decontamination of the digestive tract, was acceptable to parents and staff with adaptations, including training to improve consent and communication, and adaptations to the administration protocol for the paste and ecology monitoring. Clinical outcomes that were considered important included duration of organ failure and hospital stay, healthcare-acquired infections and survival. Limitations: The delivery of the pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to slow set-up of sites, and a lack of face-to face training. Conclusions: PICnIC’s findings indicate that a definitive cluster-randomised controlled trial in selective decontamination of the digestive tract in paediatric intensive care units is feasible with the inclusion modifications, which would need to be included in a definitive cluster-randomised controlled trial to ensure that the efficiency of trial processes is maximised.

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to determine the acceptability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and adherence to the preventive protocol among pregnant antenatal attendees in Niger Foundations Hospital Enugu, South-Eastern Nigeria Materials and Methods: Using a cross-sectional descriptive survey and in-depth interviews, we conducted a mixed method study from June to December 2021. We administered a structured questionnaire to 210 pregnant women to assess their knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and interviewed 25 individuals. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS v. 28 and thematic analysis, respectively. Results: The participants' age range was 20-43 years, with a mean of 29.9 (4.8) years. Most individuals (81.9%) had a university degree, 40.5% were skilled workers, and 73.3% had parity 0-1. They identified close contact ( 87.1% ), respiratory distress (96.2%), and handwashing with soap ( 96.2%) as the commonest mode of transmission, symptom, and preventive strategy of COVID-19, respectively. Older women and individuals with higher parity had lower knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 precautions. Most participants rejected the vaccines due to fear of the side effects on themselves and the fetus. Conclusions: Although there was good adherence to COVID-19 protocols among the pregnant women in this study, vaccine acceptance/uptake rate was low. Education on vaccine advantages and correction of conspiracy theories are recommended.

N2  - Despite having emerged from pandemic status, the incidence of COVID-19 episodes has recently increased in Spain, including pediatric cases and admissions to Intensive Care Units. Several recombinant variants are circulating among us, particularly XBB arising from two Omicron BA.2 sublineages with mutations in the genes encoding the spicule proteins that could increase binding to the ACE2 receptor and be more prone to immune escape. Faced with these, 3 pharmaceutical companies have developed vaccines adapted to the XBB.1.5 sublineage that are already available for administration in our setting with risks that should not be different from those of previous mRNA vaccines and with clearly favorable benefit/risk ratios. They should be applied to patients with potential for poor COVID-19 evolution and to collectives that have a particular relationship of proximity with them. Their application should be understood not only from a perspective of individual convenience but also from that of collective responsibility. The most convenient seems to be a simultaneous immunization of COVID-19 and influenza in our environment. In the therapeutic aspect, there is little to expect right now from antisera, but the already known antiviral drugs are still available and indicated, although their efficacy will have to be reevaluated due to their impact on populations that are mostly immunized and with a better prognosis than in the past. In our opinion, it is necessary to continue to make a reasonable and timely use of masks and other non-pharmacological means of protection.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased social isolation for mothers, and rumination exacerbates postpartum depression in mothers with poor social support. Although behavioral activation can help to decrease their depressive symptoms, the mechanism by which behavioral activation reduces postpartum depression remains unclear. Methods: We examined the effects of rumination and behavioral activation on depression in postpartum women by examining a model mediated by subjective reward perception. A questionnaire was administered to 475 postpartum women (Age: Mean = 30.74 years, SD = 5.02) within 1 year of childbirth using an Internet survey. The measurements included perinatal depression, rumination, and behavioral activation, and we assessed environmental reward. To control for confounding variables, we assessed psychiatric history, social support, parenting perfectionism, and COVID-19 avoidance. Results: Eighty-four (17.68%) mothers had possible postpartum depression. The covariance structure analysis showed that not only was there a direct positive path from rumination to postnatal depression but also a negative path via reward perception. Discussion: This finding indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic could have increased depression in many of the mothers. Rumination not only directly relates to postpartum depression, but it could also indirectly relate to postpartum depression by decreasing exposure to positive reinforcers. In addition, having a history of psychiatric illness increases the effect of rumination on postpartum depression. These findings suggest that psychological interventions are needed to reduce rumination and increase contact with positive reinforcements to reduce postpartum depression, especially for high-risk groups.

N2  - Extracellular vesicles are nanoscale vesicles that transport signals between cells, mediating both physiological and pathological processes. EVs facilitate conserved intercellular communication. By transferring bioactive molecules between cells, EVs coordinate systemic responses, regulating homeostasis, immunity, and disease progression. Given their biological importance and involvement in pathogenesis, EVs show promise as biomarkers for veterinary diagnosis, and candidates for vaccine production, and treatment agents. Additionally, different treatment or engineering methods could be used to boost the capability of extracellular vesicles. Despite the emerging veterinary interest, EV research has been predominantly human-based. Critical knowledge gaps remain regarding isolation protocols, cargo loading mechanisms, in vivo biodistribution, and species-specific functions. Standardized methods for veterinary EV characterization and validation are lacking. Regulatory uncertainties impede veterinary clinical translation. Advances in fundamental EV biology and technology are needed to propel the veterinary field forward. This review introduces EVs from a veterinary perspective by introducing the latest studies, highlighting their potential while analyzing challenges to motivate expanded veterinary investigation and translation.

N2  - Background: Prior studies have explored the association between perceived parental rejection-warmth and adolescents’ rumination, but it is unclear whether the interaction between perceived parental rejection and warmth can predict adolescents’ rumination in a Chinese context and whether this interaction varies by children’s gender during the post-COVID-19 era. Objective: This study aimed to address these issues in Chinese early adolescents from a family system perspective. Methods: A total of 910 adolescents (Mage = 13.63, 48.50% female) from two middle schools in Chongqing and Changsha, China participated in the survey, answering measures for demographics, perceived parental rejection-warmth, and rumination. Results: The results show that adolescents’ rumination was positively related to perceived paternal rejection (r = 0.326, p <.001) and maternal rejection (r = 0.343, p <.001), and negatively related to perceived paternal warmth (r = -.184, p <.001) and maternal warmth (r = -0.125, p <.001). Moreover, perceived maternal warmth significantly moderated the link between perceived paternal rejection and adolescents’ rumination (boot effect = -0.066, 95CI% = [-0.124, -0.010]), but this moderating effect is only presented in boys not in girls (boot effect = -0.063, 95CI% = [-0.015, 0.140]). However, perceived paternal warmth moderated the link between perceived maternal rejection and rumination in adolescents (boot effect = -0.052, 95CI% = [-0.103, -0.001]), and this interaction varied by adolescents’ gender (boot effect = 0.103, 95CI% = [0.029, 0.177]). Conclusions: Perceived Parental rejection and parental warmth co-exist in the Chinese family system, and they exert an interactive effect on adolescents’ rumination depending on their gender. It implies that both parents should be more accepting, caring, considerate, and warm toward their daughters, and it is also in line with the tradition and status quo of parenting in Chinese families. These findings have implications for Chinese parental co-parenting practices in families with adolescents and adolescence mental health counseling work.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a partial lockdown in Malaysia known as Movement-Controlled-Order (MCO), which has affected primary care management and social life norms. Thus, psychological health is a concern for mothers, particularly during the postpartum period. This study aimed to determine factors associated with maternal emotional experiences and coping during the pandemic. Methodology: Mothers of infants aged < 18 months (n = 1449) in Malaysia completed an online survey during MCO (July 2020 to February 2021). The survey comprised questions on sociodemographics, pandemic livelihood impact, maternal experiences, and emotions. Results: More than one-third of mothers expressed feeling worried (54.7%), annoyed (48.1%), and tired (42.2%) to some or a high extent. Mothers who were younger (p =.001), more educated (p =.001), faced difficulty paying rent (p =.002), and whose husbands were unemployed (p <.001) expressed higher negative emotions. In contrast, mothers who received enough support for health (p =.001) and breastfeeding (p =.008), had infants sleep less (p =.042) and had more time to focus on health (p <.001) expressed better emotions. Higher coping was expressed among mothers with a higher household income (p =.004), had more time to focus on their health (p =.010), received additional breastfeeding support (p = 0.039), and practised traditional postpartum care (p <.001). In contrast, difficulty paying for essentials (p =.023) was associated with negative coping. Conclusion: Maternal emotional experiences were significantly associated with sociodemographic characteristics, livelihood impact, postnatal experiences, and infant behaviours. Postpartum mental health screening is recommended to prevent severe distress, especially in first-time mothers. Coping interventions for mothers at risk may include comprehensive support and maternity care.

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization in Mexico, including oral health, mental health, communicable disease visits, health checkups, chronic degenerative disease visits, postpartum care, prenatal care, and family planning visits. Study design: This was a retrospective ecological analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, the Mexican government recommended non-essential consultations be suspended or rescheduled to accommodate the new demand for healthcare services from COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study uses administrative data from Mexico's Ministry of Health from January 2017 to December 2022. These data cover 14,299 consultation units and 775 hospitals from the 32 Mexican States, all of which are public institutions. A difference-in-differences strategy and an event study specification are used to study the impacts of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. Results: The findings reveal a decrease in the utilization of all healthcare services: oral health (69%), mental health (27%), communicable diseases (46%), chronic degenerative diseases (36%), health checkups (62%), family planning (45%), prenatal care (36%), and postpartum care (44%). Furthermore, the event study indicates that most services follow a U-shaped trend, although only mental health services clearly return to prepandemic levels. The remainder of services remain below prepandemic levels at the end of 2022. Conclusions: The 2020 pandemic had detrimental effects on non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. The healthcare interruptions will likely impact short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Programs intended to remediate these negative consequences may be of interest to public health policymakers.

N2  - Background: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the training and wellbeing of obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) trainees. The aim of this review is to offer a worldwide overview on its’ impact on the mental health of O&G trainees, so that measures can be put into place to better support trainees during the transition back to the ‘new normal’. Methods: Key search terms used on PubMed and Google Scholar databases include: mental health, COVID-19, O&G, trainees, residents. Results: Fifteen articles (cumulative number of respondents = 3230) were identified, of which eight employed validated questionnaires (n = 1807 respondents), while non-validated questionnaires were used in seven (n = 1423 respondents). Studies showed that COVID-19 appeared to exert more of a negative impact on females and on senior trainees’ mental health, while protective factors included marriage/partner and having had children. Validated and non-validated questionnaires suggested that trainees were exposed to high levels of anxiety and depression. Their mental health was also affected by insomnia, stress, burnout and fear of passing on the virus. Discussion: This review analyses the global impact of COVID-19 on O&G trainees’ mental health, showing a pervasive negative effect linked to fear of the virus. Limited psychological support has led to prolonged issues, hindering patient safety and increasing sick leave. The study underscores the urgency of comprehensive support, particularly in female-dominated fields. Addressing these challenges is crucial for future pandemics, highlighting the need to learn from past mistakes and prioritise mental health resources for trainee well-being during and beyond pandemics.

N2  - The theory of fetal programming of adult diseases was first proposed by David J.P. Barker in the eighties of the previous century, to explain the higher susceptibility of some people toward the development of ischemic heart disease. According to his hypothesis, poor maternal living conditions during gestation represent an important risk factor for the onset of atherosclerotic heart disease later in life. The analysis of the early phases of fetal development is a fundamental tool for the risk stratification of children and adults, allowing the identification of susceptible or resistant subjects to multiple diseases later in life. Here, we provide a narrative summary of the most relevant evidence supporting the Barker hypothesis in multiple fields of medicine, including neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease, kidney failure, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer onset and progression, metabolic syndrome, and infectious diseases including COVID-19. Given the consensus on the role of body weight at birth as a practical indicator of the fetal nutritional status during gestation, every subject with a low birth weight should be considered an “at risk” subject for the development of multiple diseases later in life. The hypothesis of the “physiological regenerative medicine,” able to improve fetal organs’ development in the perinatal period is discussed, in the light of recent experimental data indicating Thymosin Beta-4 as a powerful growth promoter when administered to pregnant mothers before birth.

N2  - Sex differences in the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been consistently reported, showing disproportionally high rates of anxiety/distress in women relative to men. The mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain unclear. The present study queries the potential protective role of early hyperandrogenism on brain development. A natural model of sex-steroids abnormality, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), was used to test this question. CAH is characterized by adrenal androgen overproduction in utero (prenatal) through the neonatal critical developmental period. An online survey collected information on subjective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Matched on demographic variables, 60 adults carrying a diagnosis of classic CAH and 240 adults from the general population (non-CAH) were compared on levels of anxiety/distress in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020-April 2021). Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the modulation by CAH status of Sex effects on anxiety/distress. Results revealed lower levels of anxiety/distress in the female CAH group compared to the other 3 groups (male CAH, female non-CAH, and male non-CAH). This finding suggests that pre-neonatal hyperandrogenism might impact the development of neural circuits underlying anxiety processes, in a way that enhances resilience to chronic stress.

N2  - Background: Endometriosis is a persistent inflammatory condition that affects women of reproductive age and causes pelvic pain. Chronic pelvic pain is a chronic regional pain syndrome involving the pelvic area. Objectives: This survey aimed to characterize the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyles, quality of life, and perceptions of quality of care in women with endometriosis who reported chronic pelvic pain during the Covid pandemic. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Italian population from July to September 2021. Methods: Snowball sampling was used to interview a large sample of adult women who reported a diagnosis of endometriosis, through a self-reported questionnaire. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with chronic pelvic pain. The primary outcome was describing women who reported chronic pelvic pain. Results: A total of 661 out of 1045 (63%) women who responded to the survey reported chronic pelvic pain. The multivariable analysis evidenced that chronic pelvic pain was related to physical and mental quality perception, pelvic floor disorders (adjusted odds ratio = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.10–2.27; p = 0.012), dyspareunia (adjusted odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.31–2.65; p < 0.001), adhesions syndrome (adjusted odds ratio = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.05–2.11; p = 0.026), and the delay in diagnosing endometriosis (adjusted odds ratio = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.00–1.09; p = 0.034). The only social factor associated with chronic pelvic pain was marital status (adjusted odds ratio = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.46–0.93; p = 0.019). Conclusion: In the pandemic period, there was a very high prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women with endometriosis in Italy. The pandemic highlighted the need for careful attention to diagnose endometriosis and the need for psychological and partner support, which would allow better pain management and prevent chronicity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE An increase in maternal use of licit or illicit substances, alcohol, and tobacco has resulted in an increased incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). In recent years, NAS management has shifted to initiating an Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) approach prior to pharmacologic treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ESC in combination with pharmacologic treatment in the management of NAS for infants exposed to substance use in utero. METHODS This single system, multisite, retrospective cohort study evaluated infants with known exposure to substance or polysubstance use in utero or those who had signs and symptoms of withdrawal with a positive toxicology screen. The primary outcome of rate of pharmacologic therapy initiated was evaluated pre and post implementation of ESC. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, day of life that pharmacologic therapy was initiated, and an evaluation of the ESC guideline. A subgroup analysis with similar outcomes was also performed for patients with maternal polysubstance use. RESULTS A total of 2843 patients were screened, and 50 patients were randomly selected for inclusion in both pre-and post-groups. The rate of pharmacologic therapy initiated post implementation of ESC decreased from 58% to 30% (p < 0.01). In the post-group, there was a decrease in the number of patients requiring scheduled morphine (33%, p < 0.01) and duration of pharmacologic therapy (14.6 days vs 6.47 days, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Implementing an ESC guideline decreased the length of stay and rate of pharmacologic intervention needed for infants with NAS at our institution.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic characterised a unique and vulnerable social, emotional, and health environment for pregnancy, with potential long-lasting risks to maternal and child health outcomes. In women who were pregnant at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the association between pandemic-related concerns about pregnancy and delivery and both the parent’s (i.e. maternal parenting stress) and the infant’s (i.e. emotional-behavioral problems) outcomes 12 months after birth. Methods: A sample of 352 Italian pregnant women completed a web-based survey from 8 April to 4 May 2020 and a follow-up at 12 months after delivery. Maternal assessment in pregnancy covered prenatal measures for: pandemic-related concerns about pregnancy and childbirth, COVID-19 stressful events exposure, pandemic psychological stress, and mental-health symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety). The 12 months’ assessment covered post-partum measures of social support, parenting stress and maternal reports of infants’ behavioral problems. Results: The results of the Quasi-Poisson regression models on the association between COVID-19 related influencing factors and parenting stress and infant’s behavioral problems showed that the presence of higher pandemic-related concerns about pregnancy and childbirth scores was associated with greater total and internalising behavioral problems but not with parenting stress levels. Conclusion: Perinatal mother-infant health has been sensitively threatened by pandemic consequences with maternal concerns about childbirth in pregnancy being associated with 12 months’ children’s behavioral outcomes. There is a need to invest in psychological support for perinatal women throughout the transition to parenthood to protect risk conditions before they get chronic or severe and influence offspring development.

N2  - Background: Current international guidelines recommend a pre-Ramadan risk assessment for people with diabetes (PwDM) who plan on fasting during the Holy month. However, a comprehensive risk assessment-based recommendation for the management of PwDM intending to fast is still controversial. Therefore, the Arabic Association for the Study of Diabetes and Metabolism (AASD) developed this consensus to provide further insights into risk stratification in PwDM intending to fast during Ramadan. Methods: The present consensus was based on the three-step modified Delphi method. The modified Delphi method is based on a series of voting rounds and in-between meetings of the expert panel to reach agreements on the statements that did not reach the consensus level during voting. The panel group comprised professors and consultants in endocrinology (both adult and pediatric). Other members included experts in the fields of cardiovascular medicine, nephrology, ophthalmology, and vascular surgery, affiliated with academic institutions in Egypt. Result: In PwDM who intend to fast during Ramadan, risk stratification is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and prevent serious complications. The present consensus provides risk assessment of those living with diabetes according to several factors, including the type of diabetes, presence, and severity of complications, number of fasting hours, and other socioeconomic factors. According to their risk factors, patients were classified into four categories (very high, high, moderate, and low risk). Conclusion: Future research is warranted due to the controversial literature regarding the impact of fasting on certain comorbidities.

N2  - Objective: To longitudinally assess domestic violence (DV) during the postpartum period, identifying types, patterns and determinants of DV, according to mothers’ reports in Fortaleza, Brazil. Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24% of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11% of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 17–20% of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 3–5% of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.2–1.6% of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12% in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of family’s poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV. Conclusion: Prevalence of DV was considerably high in the postpartum period. DV prevention policies should rely on improving care to women’s mental health; preventing food insecurity; and fostering the educational level of young people of both sexes.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to determine psychosocial differences between children with Long-COVID Syndrome (LCS) and two control groups (i.e., children who did not have COVID-19 and children who had previously had COVID-19 but did not develop LCS) from a bio-psycho-social and psychosomatic perspective. To classify children in these three groups, we examined the percentage of children meeting criteria for LCS, the type, frequency, perceived severity of symptoms, and their prevalence compared with children who never had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Data were collected from 198 Italian mothers of children aged 4 to 13 years using a cross-sectional web-based case-control survey. Of these, 105 were mothers of children who had contracted SARS-CoV-2 and 94 were mothers of children who had previously had COVID-19. Information was collected on the type and frequency of symptoms commonly referred to as “Long-COVID symptoms” and psychosocial dimensions (i.e., maternal and child health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, adjustment, and child deprivation). Descriptive analyses, chi-square tests, Student's T-Test, and analyses of variance were performed. Results: 29 children (15% of the total sample) developed LCS, mostly in the neurological/neuropsychiatric domain (59%), and of mild intensity. Regarding psychosocial and psychological dimensions, maternal health anxiety, child deprivation, and fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection differed between groups, with the first two dimensions higher in children with LCS than in controls and the latter lower in children with LCS than in controls. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the need of integrating a psychosocial approach into the medical care of children with LCS and their caregivers.

N2  - This article aimed to analyze recommendations for health education for pregnant and postpartum women in times of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is an integrative review that took place from September 2021 to February 2022, in the MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scientific Electronic Library Online and the Virtual Health Library. The online software Endnote Web was used to store the references obtained in the search and to remove duplications. The final sample consisted of 17 studies. After analysis, the findings were divided into two categories: health education for prenatal care of pregnant women and health education for the physical and mental well-being of pregnant and postpartum women. The study showed that the recommendations for pregnant and puerperal women, in the pandemic scenario, emphasize health education associated with technological tools throughout the pregnancy-puerperal process, based on information and strategies that favor health promotion and disease prevention.

N2  - Background: Spontaneous abortions occur in 12.5% of pregnancies and have a significant impact on the well-being of women. Dissatisfaction with health services is well-documented, but no studies have been conducted in district health services of the Western Cape. The aim was to explore the lived experiences of women presenting with spontaneous abortions to the emergency department at Helderberg Hospital. Methods: A descriptive phenomenological qualitative study used criterion-based purposive sampling to identify suitable participants. Data were collected through semi-structured individual interviews. Atlas-ti (version 22) software assisted with data analysis using the framework method. Results: A total of nine participants were interviewed. There were four main themes: a supportive environment, staff attitudes and behaviour, the impact of time, and sharing of information. The comfort, cleanliness and privacy of the environment were important. COVID-19 had also impacted on this. Showing interest, demonstrating empathy and being nonjudgemental were important, as well as the waiting time for definitive treatment and the time needed to assimilate and accept the diagnosis. In addition, the ability to give relevant information, explain the diagnosis and help patients share in decision-making were key issues. Conclusion: This study highlighted the need for a more person-centred approach and managers should focus on changes to organisational culture through training and clinical governance activities. Attention should be paid to the physical environment, availability of patient information materials and sequential coordination of care with primary care services. Contribution: This study identifies issues that can improve person-centredness and women’s satisfaction with care for spontaneous abortion.

N2  - Background: There are often delays in accessing care and diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), with little data from Southern Africa on the clinical profile of affected children and adolescents. Aim: To describe the socio-demographic and clinical variables of children and adolescents with ASD attending psychiatric services at two state hospitals in eThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Setting: Two state hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods: The retrospective chart review examined patient records for the period 01 January 2018 to 31 December 2021. Data were collated using a structured data questionnaire on birth and family history, current presentation, comorbid conditions, medications, and non-pharmacological interventions. Results: Of the 67 children and adolescents accessing care for ASD during the study period (including the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic lockdown period), most were males (89%), with a mean age standard deviation (s.d.) of 10.69 (s.d. 2.64) years. There was a delay between recognition of first symptoms and an ASD diagnosis of approximately three years. The most common reasons for referral were behavioural problems and speech delay, with 57 patients having delayed milestones (85%). Comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was reported in 55.2% (n = 37) of the patients and intellectual disability in 50.7% (n = 34), and the commonest comorbid medical condition was epilepsy (n = 20; 29.8%). All participants were on psychotropic medications, with 40 (59%) being on more than one agent. Conclusion: The delay in diagnosing ASD, high rates of comorbidity, and need for polypharmacy are concerning. Contribution: The study highlights the need for greater awareness of ASD in communities and health care workers to expedite diagnosis and facilitate prompt psychosocial support and rehabilitation.

N2  - Background Postpartum women with overweight/obesity and a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes are at elevated risk for cardiometabolic disease. Postpartum weight loss and lifestyle changes can decrease these risks, yet traditional face-to-face interventions often fail. We adapted the Diabetes Prevention Program into a theory-based mobile health (mHealth) program called Fit After Baby (FAB) and tested FAB in a randomized controlled trial. Methods The FAB program provided 12 weeks of daily evidence-based content, facilitated tracking of weight, diet, and activity, and included weekly coaching and gamification with points and rewards. We randomized women at 6 weeks postpartum 2:1 to FAB or to the publicly available Text4baby (T4B) app (active control). We measured weight and administered behavioral questionnaires at 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postpartum, and collected app user data. Results 81 eligible women participated (77% White, 2% Asian, 15% Black, with 23% Hispanic), mean baseline BMI 32±5 kg/m2 and age 31±5 years. FAB participants logged into the app a median of 51/84 (IQR 25,71) days, wore activity trackers 66/84 (IQR 43,84) days, logged weight 17 times (IQR 11,24), and did coach check-ins 5.5/12 (IQR 4,9) weeks. The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted data collection for the primary 12-month endpoint, and impacted diet, physical activity, and body weight for many participants. At 12 months postpartum women in the FAB group lost 2.8 kg [95% CI -4.2,-1.4] from baseline compared to a loss of 1.8 kg [95% CI -3.8,+0.3] in the T4B group (p = 0.42 for the difference between groups). In 60 women who reached 12 months postpartum before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, women randomized to FAB lost 4.3 kg [95% CI -6.0,-2.6] compared to loss in the control group of 1.3 kg [95% CI -3.7,+1.1] (p = 0.0451 for the difference between groups). Conclusions There were no significant differences between groups for postpartum weight loss for the entire study population. Among those unaffected by the COVID pandemic, women randomized to the FAB program lost significantly more weight than those randomized to the T4B program. The mHealth FAB program demonstrated a substantial level of engagement. Given the scalability and potential public health impact of the FAB program, the efficacy for decreasing cardiometabolic risk by increasing postpartum weight loss should be tested in a larger trial.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to identify medical care transformations during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the economic efficiency of these care transformations. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewing and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases used in the search protocol included PubMed, RSCI, and Google Scholar. Results: Ten eligible studies in English and one publication in Russian were identified. In general, the following changes in organization of health care processes since 2020 are observed: hospital at home, telemedicine (physician-to-patient), and the adoption of new information communication technologies within physician-to-physician and physician-to-nurse communication. Earlier trends, such as (a) wider use of electronic devices, (b) adoption of Lean techniques, (c) the incorporation of patient and other customer experience feedback, and (d) the implementation of clinical decision support systems and automation of workflow, tend to be preserved. Conclusion: The most common changes in hospital care organization and the respective impacts of workflow changes (ie, workflow interventions, redesign, and transformations) on the efficiency of hospital care were summarized and avenues for future research and policy implications were discussed. The pandemic demonstrated a need for building more resilient and adaptive healthcare systems, enhancing crisis preparedness along with rapid and effective responses.

N2  - Axial spondyloarthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated systemic inflammatory disease encompassing ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis. TNF inhibitors are the preferred second line therapy for patients with active axial spondyloarthritis. Certolizumab pegol is a TNF inhibitor approved for treatment of both. Three large phase III trials (RAPID-axSpA, C-axSpAnd and C-OPTIMISE) and one large phase IV trial (CIMAX) establish its clinical efficacy in treatment of active disease and maintenance of remission for both diseases. Real world evidence demonstrates clinical efficacy and benefits including reduced bone loss, reduced risk of uveitis, safety in pregnancy and lactation and index drug survival of 10 years. It is generally well tolerated, though can be associated with increased risk of serious infections.

N2  - Perinatal depression (PND) and anxiety affect around 20% of women, but available pharmacotherapy is not sufficiently effective in 20–60% of them, indicating a need for better understanding of these diseases. Since stress is a significant risk factor for PND, the aim was to examine the role of biological, environmental and psychological stress in PND and anxiety through a systematic literature search. Overall 210 studies were included, among which numerous rodent studies showed that perinatal stress induced depressive-like and anxious behavior, which was associated with HPA-axis alterations and morphological brain changes. Human studies indicated that the relationship between cortisol and perinatal depression/anxiety was not as clear and with many contradictions, although social and psychological stress were clearly positively associated with PND. Finally, oxytocin, synthetic neuroactive steroid and n-3 PUFA diet have been identified as potentially beneficial in the therapy of PND and anxiety, worth to be investigated in the future.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women are said to have higher stress levels than non-pregnant women, but as non US studies have shown, stress increased during the pandemic due to the unique circumstances of unpredictability, fear of infection, limited access to health services, and financial uncertainty. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of stress associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic among pregnant women in Slovenia and to determine in which areas they experienced the greatest stress. Methods: A descriptive and causal non-experimental method of empirical research was used. The research approach was based on quantitative research, and a validated questionnaire-Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) was used as the research instrument. Eleven hundred and four pregnant women participated in the study. Results: We found that more than one-third of the participants experienced high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data demonstrated that those who were pregnant for the first time, had a high-risk pregnancy, experienced income loss, and were in their second or third trimester had higher levels of stress. The highest stress level was reported due to concern about infection. More specifically, 54.4% of pregnant women experienced high levels of stress related to fear of infection and in 47% high stress levels were related to fear with regard to childbirth. Conclusions: Respondents reported a range of mild to severe stress. They worried about the baby, about the need for isolation during labor and delivery, and about losing their social network in the postpartum period. It is important to know that stress during pregnancy also affects the fetus. We suggest that it would be useful to screen pregnant women for stress, with PREPS being used for this purpose. All women with high stress levels should be offered interventions, e.g., online stress reduction counselling.

N2  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes a highly contagious enteric disease with major economic losses to swine production worldwide. Due to the immaturity of the neonatal piglet immune system and given the high virulence of PEDV, improving passive lactogenic immunity is the best approach to protect suckling piglets against the lethal infection. We tested whether oral vitamin A (VA) supplementation and PEDV exposure of gestating and lactating VA-deficient (VAD) sows would enhance their primary immune responses and boost passive lactogenic protection against the PEDV challenge of their piglets. We demonstrated that PEDV inoculation of pregnant VAD sows in the third trimester provided higher levels of lactogenic protection of piglets as demonstrated by >87% survival rates of their litters compared with <10% in mock litters and that VA supplementation to VAD sows further improved the piglets’ survival rates to >98%. We observed significantly elevated PEDV IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) titers and Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) in VA-sufficient (VAS)+PEDV and VAD+VA+PEDV sows, with the latter maintaining higher Ab titers in blood prior to parturition and in blood and milk throughout lactation. The litters of VAD+VA+PEDV sows also had the highest serum PEDV-neutralizing Ab titers at piglet post-challenge days (PCD) 0 and 7, coinciding with higher PEDV IgA ASCs and Ab titers in the blood and milk of their sows, suggesting an immunomodulatory role of VA in sows. Thus, sows that delivered sufficient lactogenic immunity to their piglets provided the highest passive protection against the PEDV challenge. Maternal immunization during pregnancy (± VA) and VA sufficiency enhanced the sow primary immune responses, expression of gut–mammary gland trafficking molecules, and passive protection of their offspring. Our findings are relevant to understanding the role of VA in the Ab responses to oral attenuated vaccines that are critical for successful maternal vaccination programs against enteric infections in infants and young animals.

N2  - Background: Determining the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant and recently pregnant women is important to identify risk factors in order to evaluate complications and maternal and perinatal outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women and its effects on the newborn. Methods: This prospective descriptive study was conducted from December 2020 to November 2021 on 101 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit in JLNMCH, Bhagalpur, Bihar. All studied patients were examined in terms of clinical symptoms, maternal and neonatal complications, and laboratory findings such as WBC and ESR in all patients were checked. Finally, all information was entered into each patient's form and by using SPSS V22 software analyzed. Results: Number of 101 pregnant women participated in the study, with an average age of 31.09 years. In this study, 93 individuals had PCR positive (92.1%), 84 individuals with COVID+ in CT scan (83.2%), 25 individuals with an underlying disease (24.8%), and 54 individuals with addiction (53.5%). 20 feet (19.8%) were reported. 20 deaths (19.8%) were reported. The average BMI of the participants was 25.46. Among maternal complications, pulmonary involvement (71.28%) the most frequently was reported. Among the hospitalized patients (95 individuals), 25 individuals had underlying diseases. In this population, maternal complications were significantly more reported (P value=0.012). Among neonatal complications, the most common cases of death were IUFD and abortion. 62.1% of the participants had a natural delivery and 63.4% had a term delivery. Conclusion: Fever, throat redness and swelling, respiratory distress and cough are the most common clinical symptoms and lung involvement is the most common complication of COVID infection in pregnant mothers. In infants, IUFD and abortion were also very common. PCR and CT scan are two high-sensitivity tests for detecting COVID.

N2  - Purpose: Perinatal Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs) address severe perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) and mother-infant relationship concerns. Given the impact of PMADs on mothers and infants, rapid transitions to virtual services (telehealth) amid COVID-19, and service expansions to populations in need, it is critical to evaluate how effectively virtual and in-person perinatal IOP services treat PMADs and mother-infant bonding. Methods: This quality-improvement record review examined patient records (n = 361) for a perinatal IOP from May 2016 to July 2023, amid multiple transitions between in-person and virtual services related to COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Patients in the completed measures sample (n = 115) completed depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7, PASS), and mother-infant bonding (PBQ) measures over the first 3 weeks of treatment. Patients also anonymously provided program satisfaction ratings and qualitative feedback. Results: While anxiety and depression symptoms improved similarly across service settings, mother-baby bonding only significantly improved with in-person treatment. Patient symptom outcomes also differed by public/private insurance, race, and number of children. Patients reported high service ratings and overall satisfaction, and available feedback indicates some preference for in-person services. Conclusion: As perinatal mental health services and IOPs continue to expand, virtual services can similarly address anxiety and depression symptoms and help to reach in-need populations. However, for perinatal IOPs, the core treatment target of mother-infant bonding may be uniquely addressed via in-person services.

N2  - This work was a descriptive study that analyzed the performance of health services in 112 municipalities (g100) characterized by more than 80,000 inhabitants, low public revenue, and socioeconomic vulnerability. Based on the Proje-to de Avaliação de Desempenho do Sistema de Saúde, 31 indicators of funding, resources, access, effectiveness, acceptability, and appropriateness were selected for the period of 2017-2020, and were compared to the variations of each year’s indicators year on year. In 2020, an increase in funding, especially SUS transfers (31.6%), was observed. The availability of hospital beds had been decreasing between 2017 and 2019, but began to increase again in 2020; likewise, the availability of health professionals also showed a slight increase. A decline was observed in cervi-cal and breast cancer screening exams of nearly 40% (2020), as well as a decrease in surgical pro-cedures, such as cataracts and angioplasties. The hospitalizations due to conditions manageable by primary care were 15.8% in 2020, 14.1% lower than in 2019. A 55.8% increase in mortality due to diabetes and greater tuberculosis treatment non-adherence was also observed. The pandemic context calls for caution when interpreting results, which highlight access barriers and post-ponements of proper health care.

N2  - Background: Although underdeveloped in Iraq, telehealth was one tool used to continue health service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: To assess women’s experiences and satisfaction with gynaecological and obstetric telehealth services in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Free telehealth services were provided by 4 obstetrician-gynaecologists associated with private clinics in 2020–2021. All patients who accessed the services between June 2020 and February 2021 were invited to complete a post-consultation survey on their experience and satisfaction with services. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression conducted using SPSS version 25. Results: A total of 151 (30.2%) women responded to the survey. Two-thirds (61.6%) of them were between the ages of 19 and 30 years. Some 50.3% learned about telehealth through social media. Gynaecological consultations accounted for 48.3% of all visits, obstetric consultations 42.4% and consultations for both gynaecological and obstetric care 9.3%. Overall, 57.0% of the women were satisfied, 7.9% were dissatisfied and 35.1% neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. Some 82.7 % intended to continue using telehealth after the pandemic. Conclusion: The high-level satisfaction of women with telehealth for gynaecological and obstetric services during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that telehealth may be a valuable complement to in-person services. Strengthening telehealth systems could be a promising strategy for increasing access to, and efficiency of, select health services beyond the pandemic.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal health services may be adversely impacted during pandemics especially in the low- and middle-income countries. COVID-19 pandemic was such a situation. Here, we describe the status of maternal health services prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional household-based survey was conducted among randomly selected 820 mothers with children less than 2 years in Chandigarh and Kalyani, West Bengal, to assess the utilization of antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care services before March 2020 (pre-pandemic period, n = 413) and after March 2020 (pandemic period, n = 407). Data were managed using REDCap and were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 25.0). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and significant differences between groups at 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: There was a significant increase in the reporting of pregnancy-related complications during the pandemic (aOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.08–1.94) and a significant increase in utilization of supplementary nutrition services from anganwadis (aOR 1.81; 95% CI 1.33–2.46) during the pandemic. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of women who received financial assistance during delivery in the pandemic period (aOR 0.36; 95% CI 0.17–0.79). Postpartum checkups by healthcare workers significantly decreased during the pandemic period (82.6%) as compared with the pre-pandemic period (82.6%) [aOR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71–0.97]. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed the utilization of antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum services in our study areas. While the existing national program and timely pandemic guidelines helped ensure that some services remained uninterrupted, postpartum care was the most affected possibly due to restrictions of field visits by the healthcare workers. Financial assistance for delivery care was also heavily affected during the pandemic.

N2  - Primary Health Care (PHC) proved to be an important part of the prevention, control and treatment measures against COVID-19, a situation in which it was challenged to keep up its provision of regular services as well. This article identifies the main arrangements made to provide PHC care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrative literature review of articles found in PubMed, SciELO and LILACS databases was performed using the descriptors “Primary Health Care” and “COVID-19”. Findings were analyzed considering three questions: Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Organizations of Work Processes and Non-COVID Chronic Diseases. The use of different forms of ICT to provide PHC is highlighted regarding patients with respiratory symptoms and chronic patients. Changes in team composition, service flows, physical spaces and working hours were also introduced. Although strategies aimed at monitoring chronic patients and at remote care may have helped minimize deterioration of their health, the decrease in the number of visits performed during this period could have resulted in an increased demand for PHC in post-pandemic years.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the pleasant experiences of pregnancy and childbirth for women a source of fear and anxiety. Objective: To explore the experiences of pregnant women during pregnancy and childbirth in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This qualitative conventional content analysis was conducted in Tehran, Iran, in May and June 2020. The 15 participants were selected via purposeful sampling including: 12 pregnant women, 2 relatives, and one nurse. Data were collected using in-depth and semi-structured interviews and the analysis adopted by Graneheim and Lundman (2004). MAXQDA version 12 was used for data organization. Results: According to the findings, 12 sub-categories, 6 categories, and one theme were extracted. The main theme that was derived from the analysis of the data was “ the interweaving of pain and perfection”. The categories include “emotional disorders”, “obsessive disorders”, “psychological disorders”, “strengthening the dimension of spirituality” “the need for more support resources”, and “inadequacy in presenting the role of motherhood”. Conclusion: According to the experiences of pregnant women during pregnancy and childbirth during the outbreak of COVID-19, social, psychological, and emotional support through family and healthcare providers is recommended, as is the formation of virtual counseling groups to answer the questions of pregnant women. Health policymakers and decision-makers can use the results of this research to plan for providing services for pregnant women during future pandemics.

N2  - Background: When a pregnant woman gets COVID-19 infection, she is more likely to develop COVID 19 disease and poor new born outcome as compared to non-pregnant woman. Therefore, vaccination has been shown to be the most practicable and effective means of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to expectant mothers and their unborn child, as well as any major illness or other consequences, by eliciting immune responses during pregnancy. As far as our knowledge, there has been only few studies done to determine how many pregnant Indian women accept the COVID-19 vaccine in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to identify the associated factors that affect vaccination acceptability. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study carried out in a tertiary care hospital setting from May 2023 to July 2023 in the Obstetrics Department of the Maharaja Suhel Dev Autonomous State Medical College and hospital, Bahraich Uttar Pradesh. 100 pregnant women over the age of eighteen who volunteered to participate in the study were included in it. Face-to-face interviews with participants utilizing a pretested, structured questionnaire were used to gather information. We employed Chi square to find the factors that were related to vaccination acceptability. Result: 10 of the 100 pregnant women indicated that they would be willing to get the vaccination, yielding an acceptance percentage of 10%. The association between vaccine acceptance and age of the pregnant females, occupation of the pregnant females and type of family was statistically significant. Knowledge about the availability of COVID 19 vaccine in pregnant female was 75%. There is no significant association found between knowledge of vaccine and age, education, type of family and occupation of pregnant females. Conclusion: In this study, there was a low level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. Key reason for refusal were fear of the vaccination's negative effects and potential harm to the unborn child. In the course of pregnancy care, medical professionals ought to stress the advantages of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine while expecting.

N2  - Introduction: childbirth experiences are women´s personal feelings and interpretations of birth processes, which could be difficult to describe and explain. The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) instilled tension and worries in all Nigerian citizens and could also affect the birth experiences and satisfaction of women. Thus, this study explored the experiences of childbirth and satisfaction with birth among women in selected Nigerian healthcare facilities during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: the study adopted a concurrent triangulation mixed method design, which utilized an in-depth interview and questionnaire to obtain different but complementary data. Sample sizes of 304 and 15 women were recruited for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Analysis was done using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Results: the majority of the participants perceived childbirth to be labor and delivery (3.66 ± 3.16); participants were mostly satisfied with reception received from staff (2.35 ± 2.29) and respecting their privacy (2.04 ± 1.52). Five (5) themes and 18 subthemes emerged from qualitative data. The themes were: understanding of childbirth, satisfaction with care, hospital experiences, unique experiences during birth, and social support. Conclusion: women had more positive and less negative but unique childbirth experiences. The majority expressed satisfaction within the care given by qualified and competent health workers, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic. The provision of physical and emotional support by intimate partners, midwives´ and family members during delivery had a significant influence on maternal satisfaction with the entire birth experience.

N2  - Aim: Comparing the anxiety and depression severity and their impact on subsequent birth outcomes in pregnant women before and during Omicron wave in Shanghai in 2022. Methods: The depression-anxiety symptoms networks were compared between the pregnant women during the outbreak period (outbreak group; n = 783) and a matched control group of pregnant women before the outbreak (pre-outbreak group; n = 783). The impact of baseline mental state on follow-up pregnancy and neonatal outcomes was also explored by logistic regression. Findings: Levels of depression and anxiety between the two groups were not significant different. Network analysis showed that central symptom "trouble relaxing" and bridge symptom "depressed mood" shared by both groups. Different symptom associations in different periods of the pandemic. Total scores and sub-symptom scores of prenatal depressive and anxious severities increased the odds ratios of maternal and neonatal syndromes. The influence of mental state on gestational and neonatal outcomes differed across different pandemic periods. Conclusion: The Omicron wave did not have a significant negative impact on the depressive and anxious mood in pregnant women. Targeting central and bridge symptoms intervention may be effective in reducing their adverse effects on co-occurring of anxious and depressive mood and birth outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: This prospective cross-sectional study, conducted from 1 April 2022 to 31 October 2022, aimed to assess the knowledge, acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women visiting the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Methods: The study included all pregnant women aged ≥18 years. Sociodemographic data, information related to COVID-19 and vaccination and information on the knowledge, acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination were collected using a validated questionnaire. Results: Out of 420 eligible pregnant women, 412 participated in the study, yielding a response rate of 98.1%. Of the respondents, 97.1% had received a COVID-19 vaccine, while 2.9% had not. Approximately 85.2% demonstrated a good understanding of COVID-19 vaccination. Among those vaccinated, 76.8% based their decision on recommendations from healthcare providers or the Ministry of Health. Among those unvaccinated, 91.7% believed that COVID-19 vaccines could harm their pregnancy and baby. Although 51% of the respondents expressed concerns about vaccine safety, 202 still chose to be vaccinated, indicating a willingness to prioritise their health despite apprehensions. Conclusion: The study found no significant link between acceptance and good knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination. However, income and prior COVID-19 booster vaccination were strongly associated with acceptance. Despite safety concerns, 97.1% of the respondents had received a COVID-19 vaccine. This emphasises the importance of providing comprehensive information and addressing concerns to support informed decision-making among pregnant women. Healthcare providers play a vital role in guiding them through this crucial decision-making process.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which could have harmful consequences for pregnant women. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of postpartum depression during COVID-19 using an umbrella review and meta-analysis. Methods: The current study followed the PRISMA guideline and utilized data from various sources such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The searches were conducted without a time limit until the end of May 2023. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model, heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index, and publication bias was evaluated using Begg’s test. Data analysis was carried out using STATA software (version 15). Results: In this study, 243 articles were initially identified. Only meta-analysis studies that reported PPD during COVID-19 were included. After quality assessment, nine papers were selected for the meta-analysis stage. The study found that the prevalence postpartum depression (PPD) was 25.27% (95% CI = 23.66–27.86, I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.549). Conclusion: The findings of this study revealed that the incidence of PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. To decrease mental health issues among pregnant and postpartum women, healthcare professionals should implement community programs aimed at preventing, promptly identifying, and providing appropriate intervention for pregnant women. This is crucial as pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress during infectious disease outbreaks.

N2  - Influenza, COVID-19, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B pose increased risk for pregnant women and infants and could be mitigated by maternal immunization. In India Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended during pregnancy, while influenza and tetanus-acellular pertussis-diphtheria (Tdap) vaccines are not. We conducted a multicenter study from November 2021 to June 2022 among pregnant women (n = 172) attending antenatal clinics in three public hospitals in West Bengal, to understand the factors that influence women’s decisions to get vaccinated during pregnancy. Questions assessed vaccination coverage, knowledge, intention and willingness to pay for influenza vaccine, and factors influencing decisions to get Td, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. 152/172 (88.4%) women were vaccinated with Td, 159/172 (93%) with COVID-19, 1/172 (0.6%) with influenza, and none with Tdap. 10/168 (6%) had received hepatitis B vaccine (HBV). Community health workers advice was crucial for Td uptake and, the belief of protection from COVID for COVID-19 vaccines. Most women were unaware about Tdap (96%), influenza (75%), and influenza severity during pregnancy and infancy (85%). None were advised for influenza vaccination by healthcare providers (HCP), albeit, 93% expressed willingness to take, and pay INR 100–300 (95% CI: ≤100 to 300–500) [$ 1.3–4.0 (95% CI: ≤1.3, 4–6.7)] for it. Vaccination on flexible dates and time, HCP’s recommendation, proximity to vaccination center, and husband’s support were most important for their vaccination decisions. Women were generally vaccine acceptors and had high uptake of vaccines included in the Universal Immunization Program (UIP). Inclusion of influenza, Tdap, and HBV into UIP may improve maternal vaccine uptake.

N2  - Background. Medical staff in China faced great challenges and psychological and physiological changes of varying degrees during the omicron epidemic outbreak. It is important to recognize the potential impact of these challenges on the mental health of medical staff and to provide appropriate resources and support to mitigate their effects. Methods. A total of 354 medical staff in two obstetrics and gynecology hospitals of different grades were included in this survey using convenience sampling. The cross-sectional self-report questionnaires survey was conducted using the Basic Characteristics Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results. There were 169 (47.7%) participants suffering from anxiety disorder. Working with fever, working in obstetrics, and working with protective clothing were the risk factors for anxiety in medical staff p<0.05. One hundred and ninety-six (55.4%) participants were depressed. Working with fever and working in obstetrics were the risk factors for depression in medical staff p<0.05. There were 117 (33.1%) participants suffering from insomnia. Working with fever, high educational level, and severe COVID-19 infection status were the risk factors for insomnia in medical staff p<0.05. Moreover, medical staff in a provincial hospital were more anxious and depressed than those in a county hospital. At last, there were more participants working with fever in obstetrics p<0.05. Conclusion. Anxiety disorder, depression, and insomnia were common among obstetrics and gynecology medical staff during the outbreak of omicron pandemic. During this period, more resources for psychological counselling should be provided to the hospital as well as more reasonable staffing arrangements, and working while having a fever is prohibited, especially in provincial hospital.

N2  - Pregnancy represents a crucial timepoint to screen for disordered eating due to the significant adverse impact on the woman and her infant. There has been an increased interest in disordered eating in pregnancy since the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the mental health of pregnant women compared to the general population. This systematic review is an update to a previous review aiming to explore current psychometric evidence for any new pregnancy-specific instruments and other measures of disordered eating developed for non-pregnant populations. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, ProQuest, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Embase from April 2019 to February 2024. A total of 20 citations met criteria for inclusion, with most studies of reasonable quality. Fourteen psychometric instruments were identified, including two new pregnancy-specific screening instruments. Overall, preliminary psychometric evidence for the PEBS, DEAPS, and EDE-PV was promising. There is an ongoing need for validation in different samples, study designs, settings, and administration methods are required. Similar to the original review on this topic, we did not find evidence to support a gold standard recommendation.

N2  - Objectives: This study investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on serum irisin, preptin levels in overweight women and their relationship with routine biochemical tests. Methods: The study included 25 healthy controls and 25 overweight sedentary women (BMI>25). The exercise training was performed 3 days a week for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements were performed and fasting blood samples were collected before and after exercise period. All samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 10 minutes and the serum was separated. Serum irisine and preptin levels were analyzed by ELISA method. Routine biochemical parameters were assayed by spectrophotometric, hsCRP levels by nephelometric and insulin levels by immunoassay method using auto analyzers. Results: There was a significant decrease in BMI and fat mass in the post-exercise group compared with pre-exercise (p<0.001). Serum irisin levels were significantly lower in pre- and post-exercise group compared to controls (p<0.001), but no significant change was observed after exercise period. Preptin levels were significantly higher in the pre-exercise group (median/IQR, 558.2 /351,2-756,8 pg/ml) compared to the controls (median / IQR, 137.1/85.2-427.9 pg/ ml), and significantly reduced in post-exercise group (medium/IQR, 243.1/179.2-330 pg/ml) compared to pre-exercise group. In the pre-exercise group, a significant negative correlation was observed between irisin and body mass index (r=-0.443, p=0,027), while a positive correlation was found between preptin and body weight (r=0.438, p=0.029). Conclusions: Twelve weeks of aerobic exercise in overweight sedentary women has lowering effect on serum preptin levels but no effect on serum irisin levels.

N2  - Objective: This review aimed to assess the current evidence on the relationship between resilience and mental health employed in response to the impacts of mental health. Method: This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The protocol of this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42023470966). Three authors searched peer-reviewed articles using several electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Psych Info, EMBASE, and Web of Science, from September to October 2023 and included all the studies from any time until November 1, 2023. The review included all eligible quantitative observational and qualitative studies, irrespective of geographical boundaries. Result: Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders were found to be the most common, but not the only, mental health disorders during the perinatal period, and higher maternal resilience during perinatal periods was found to reduce mental health disorders. It was also found that pregnant women were more resilient to mental health disorders than postpartum women. Tolerance of uncertainty and a positive cognitive appraisal, women’s self-behavior and family functioning, and protective psychosocial resources such as dispositional optimism, parental sense of mastery, self-esteem, gratitude, and forgiveness were found to be the most common mechanisms of resilience among perinatal women. Older age, having an adolescent partner, family income, and distress were found to affect resilience. Conclusion: Noting that women’s resilience is an important tool to prevent perinatal mental health disorders, maternal healthcare providers need to counsel perinatal women on resilience-boosting mechanisms, such as applying self-behavior and having social support or close family relationships. It is recommended to counsel or provide psychosocial interventions for the woman’s companion or partner to give strong support for the woman in each of the perinatal periods.

N2  - This is a qualitative study that explores the perspectives and experiences of a group of Mexican women who experienced institutionalized childbirth care in the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a semi-structured script, nine women who experienced childbirth care were interviewed between March and October 2020 in public and private hospitals in the city of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. Under the Grounded Theory analysis proposal, it was identified that the health strategies implemented during the pandemic brought with them a setback in the guarantee of humanized childbirth. Women described themselves as distrustful of the protocols that personnel followed to attend to their births in public sector hospitals and very confident in those implemented in the private sector. The intervention of cesarean sections without a clear justification emerged as a constant, as did early dyad separation. Healthcare personnel’s and institutions’ willingness and conviction to guarantee, protect and defend the right of women to experience childbirth free of violence remain fragile. Resistance persists to rethink childbirth care from a non-biomedicalizing paradigm.

N2  - Background: Antenatal depression is the most prevalent pregnancy-associated mental health disorder. Previous studies have identified several risk factors for antenatal depression, including partner support. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many relationship dynamics changed. This study examined the extent to which relationship factors had an impact on antenatal depression in comparison with other well-researched factors in the context of the pandemic. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the P3 Cohort in Calgary, a longitudinal cohort study based in Alberta, Canada. Pregnant people (n = 872) completed self-report questionnaires and validated scales about sociodemographic, psychological, and relationship characteristics. Antenatal depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of reported characteristics on antenatal depression. Tests of model fit were used to examine whether the inclusion of variables related to relationship quality improved model fit after accounting for other known risk factors. Results: Overall, 18.23% of participants experienced antenatal depression. Relationship factors including relationship unhappiness (OR = 1.98 [95% CI: 1.06–3.69]), having an upsetting partner (OR = 2.00 [95% CI: 1.17–3.40]), and having a lower quality of relationships with close friends and family (OR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.14–2.73]) were associated with antenatal depression; however, inclusion of these relationship factors did not improve model fit after accounting for other known predictors. Conclusion: Overall, relationship factors were not associated with antenatal depression during the pandemic after accounting for other known risk factors. Stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic may have overshadowed the impact of relationship factors, or relationship factors may have contributed to higher levels of stress and anxiety more generally within our sample.

N2  - Background: Since the Chinese government changed its COVID-19 prevention and control policies, the rapid spread of the omicron variant resulted in a pervasive surge of infections throughout the nation, particularly affecting children. Although the acute symptoms of children infected with COVID-19 are milder compared to adults, the impact of post-COVID-19 syndromes (PCS) on the growth and development of children should not be ignored. The clinical manifestations, treatment methods, and long-term effects of children are significantly different from those of adults, making it necessary to understand the phenotype of children with PCS in order to effectively manage their health. Methods: The study focuses on hospitalized children infected with omicron variant in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from December 7, 2022, to January 5, 2023. Three telephone follow-ups with the guardians was conducted at 4–5 weeks, 12–13 weeks, and 24–25 weeks after the patients' discharge to understand their prevalence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of PCS. Results: The age range of the 112 hospitalized pediatric patients was 0–13 years, with a median age of 19 months. After three follow-ups, 49.1% patients had PCS, while the incidence of PCS persisting 3 month was 21.4%, with a prevalence of PCS persisting 6 month of 10.7%. From the first follow-up phase to the third phase, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of PCS. In infants, the most common persistent symptom was sleep disorder (19.2%), followed by respiratory symptoms, diarrhea (8.2%), and decreased appetite (6.8%). In children and adolescents, decreased appetite was the most common persistent symptom (30.8%), followed by respiratory symptoms, fatigue (15.4%), and mood changes (15.4%). Decreased appetite was more common in the children and adolescents, while diarrhea and sleep disorders were more common in the infants. Binary logistic regression analysis and ordered logistic regression analysis showed that times of illness (OR = 1.671, 95% CI: 1.339–2.086) were positively correlated with the duration of symptoms. Times of illness was positively correlated with cough/expectoration (OR = 1.491, 95% CI: 1.039–2.138). Age (OR = 0.844, 95% CI: 0.755–0.944) and re-hospitalization (OR = 0.146, 95% CI: 0.022–0.969) were positively correlated with sleep disorders. Conclusions: Children with Omicron variant may still experience PCS, but the incidence is lower compared to adults and compared to other variants and the incidence of PCS will gradually decrease over time. The symptoms of PCS differ between older children and infants and it is necessary to prevent recurrent illness for at least half a year after COVID-19 recovery. In order to further understand and ameliorate the impact of PCS on the health of children infected with COVID-19, subsequent follow-up studies will expand the scope, combine with objective follow-up contents, and establish an assessment and management system especially for children of different ages.

N2  - Background/Aims: Including women of childbearing age in a clinical trial makes it necessary to consider two factors from a bioethical perspective: first, the lack of knowledge about the potential teratogenic effects of an investigational product, and also, the principle of justice not to exclude any population from the benefits of research. The most common way to address this issue is by requiring volunteers to use contraceptives before, during, and a few weeks after the clinical trial. This work presents all the strategies used to promote contraception use and prevent pregnancy during the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative Autosomal-Dominant Alzheimer’s Disease (API ADAD) Colombia clinical trial. Two characteristics of this trial make it of special interest for closely monitoring contraception use. One is that the trial lasted more than 7 years, and the other is that participants could be carriers of the E280A PSEN1 mutation, leading to a mild cognitive impairment as early as their late 30s. Methods: An individual medical evaluation to select the contraception method that best fits the volunteer was carried out during the screening visit, remitting to the gynecologist when necessary. All non-surgical contraception methods were supplied by the sponsor. Staff were trained on contraception counseling, correctly dispensing contraceptive drugs to volunteers, and identifying, reporting, and following up on pregnancies. Two comprehensive educational campaigns on contraception use were performed, and the intervention included all volunteers. In addition, volunteers were asked on an annual survey to evaluate the dispensing procedure. Finally, the effectiveness of these strategies was retrospectively evaluated, comparing by extrapolation the number of pregnancies presented throughout the trial with the General Fertility Rate in Colombia. Results: A total of 159 female volunteers were recruited. All strategies were implemented as planned, even during the COVID-19 contingency. Ten pregnancies occurred during the evaluation period (2015–2021). Two were planned; the rest were associated with a potential therapeutic failure or incorrect use of contraceptive methods for a contraceptive failure of 0.49% per year. Sixty percent of pregnancies led to an abortion, either miscarriage or therapeutic abortion. However, there was not enough data to associate the pregnancy outcome with the administration of the investigational product. Finally, we observed a lower fertility rate in women participating in the trial compared to the Colombian population. Conclusion: The lower rates of contraceptive failure and the decrease in the incidence of pregnancies in women participating in the trial compared to the Colombian population across the 7 years of evaluation suggest that the strategies used in API ADAD Colombia were adequate and effective in addressing contraception use.

N2  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced by all cells in the body. These biological nanoparticles facilitate cellular communication through the transport of diverse cargoes, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. mRNA cargoes have gained particular interest given their role in the translation of functional proteins. As a biomarker platform, EVs can be found in nearly all biofluids—blood, mucus, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva—providing real-time insight into parent cell and tissue function. mRNAs carried by EVs are protected from degradation, resulting in improved detection compared to free mRNA, and recent work demonstrates promising results in using these mRNA cargoes as biomarkers for cancer, neurological diseases, infectious diseases, and gynecologic and obstetric outcomes. Furthermore, given the innate cargo carrying, targeting, and barrier crossing abilities of EVs, these structures have been proposed as therapeutic carriers of mRNA. Recent advances demonstrate methods for loading mRNAs into EVs for a range of disease indications. Here, we review recent studies using EVs and their mRNA cargoes as diagnostics and therapeutics. We discuss challenges associated with EVs in diagnostic and therapeutic applications and highlight opportunities for future development.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, drought and internal conflict have worsened Ethiopia’s already weak healthcare system. Antenatal and intrapartum care are especially prone to interruption under these circumstances. Objective: To explore women’s experiences receiving antenatal and intrapartum care during the pandemic. Design: A descriptive qualitative approach was utilised. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 17 women and held 4 focus group discussions with women who gave birth at 4 public hospitals during the pandemic. A study was conducted at four public hospitals in the Sidama region of Ethiopia, during which data were collected from 14 February to 10 May 2022. Thematic analysis was performed to generate themes. Results: The peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia presented several barriers to access and uptake of antenatal and intrapartum care at public hospitals. Four themes and 10 subthemes emerged from the thematic analysis. The themes were ‘Barriers to maternity care uptake during COVID-19’, ‘Shortage of resources during COVID-19’, ‘Delays in maternity care uptake during COVID-19’ and ‘Mistreatment of women during maternity care during COVID-19’. The subthemes included ‘Fear of contracting COVID-19’, ‘People in the hospital neglecting COVID-19 prevention’, ‘Women losing their job during COVID-19’, ‘Shortage of beds in the labour ward’, ‘Shortage of medical supplies’, ‘Delays in seeking care’, ‘Delays in receiving care’, ‘Complications during childbirth’, ‘disrespectful’ and ‘suboptimal care’. Conclusion: The findings of this study underscore the impact of COVID-19 on antenatal and intrapartum care, leading to delays in seeking and receiving care due to reduced rapport, resource shortages, companion restrictions, disrespectful care and suboptimal care. These factors contribute to increased obstetric complications during COVID-19. It is imperative for policymakers to prioritise essential resources for antenatal and intrapartum care in the present and future pandemics. Moreover, healthcare providers should maintain respectful and optimal care even amid challenges.

N2  - Providing care for patients with diabetes in pregnancy (DiP) provides unique challenges beyond those faced in standard antenatal care or diabetes outside of pregnancy. Teleclinics (use of telephone, email, or other technologies) as an alternative to in-person clinic appointments have become more widely used for care since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand how teleclinics might be improved for ongoing use, it is important to understand the experiences and perceptions of the clinicians involved in DiP care. Aim. To understand staff experiences of DiP teleclinics and gain their perspectives on if and how teleclinics and other technologies might be best used in the future. Methods. A qualitative study using semistructured interviews of healthcare providers in a large DiP service. Twenty staff members (midwifery, obstetrics, physician, dietician, and administration) were approached to participate. Fifteen staff across 5 specialties consented to be interviewed. Template analysis of interview transcripts was performed, with a focus on 3 themes: collaboration and working together are important for providing care for DiP, a need for flexibility in scheduling and the ability to individualise the way care is provided, and challenges to adapting to new technology. Results. Potential benefits of teleclinics were acknowledged, but respondents also viewed teleclinics as not suitable for all DiP patients due to different needs and risks. Challenges to using teleclinics include establishing good rapport and the current limited infrastructure and patient resources. Conclusion. Healthcare providers viewed teleclinics as a way of supporting rather than replacing current care. Maintaining flexibility in clinic scheduling to allow incorporation of teleclinics into patient's current schedule of visits ad hoc and providing extra technical and administrative support are important considerations for developing a teleclinic service.

N2  - Background: The incidence rate of adolescent depression and anxiety has been increasing since the outbreak of COVID-19, which there are no effective therapeutic drugs available. Si-ni San is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of depression-like as well as anxiety-like behavior, but its mechanism for treating depression combined with anxiety during adolescence is not yet clear. Methods: Network pharmacology was used to explore potential drug molecules and related targets, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were used to evaluate the interaction between the potential drug molecules and related targets, and a model of anxiety combined with depression in adolescent rats as well as the following behavioral tests and molecular biology tests were used to verify the results from network pharmacology and molecular docking. Results: As a result, 256 active ingredients of Si-ni San and 1128 potential targets were screened out. Among them, quercetin, Luteolin, kaempferol, 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, formononetin showed to be the most potential ingredients; while STAT3, IL6, TNF, AKT1, AKT1, TP53, IL1B, MAPK3, VEGFA, CASP3, MMP9 showed to be the most potential targets. AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, IL-17 signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, which are involved in anti-inflammation processes, showed to be the most probable pathways regulated by Si-ni San. Molecular docking and MD simulation between the compounds to inflammation-associated targets revealed good binding abilities of quercetin, Luteolin, kaempferol, nobiletin and formononetin to PTGS2 and PPARγ. In the experiment with adolescent rats, Si-ni San markedly suppressed early maternal separation (MS) combined with adolescent chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression combined with anxiety. The qPCR results further indicated that Si-ni San regulated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that adolescent anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by MS combined CUMS can be ameliorated by Si-ni San by improved inflammation in hippocampus via targeting TNF pathway and Nrf2 pathway, helping to reveal the mechanism of Si-ni San in treating adolescent depression combined with anxiety.

N2  - Objectives: to evaluate the second stage of the Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) and its integration with the third stage in maternity hospitals in Recife in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Methods: normative assessment carried out at the Kangaroo Neonatal Intermediate Care Unit (KNICU) in two public reference maternity hospitals for KMC between November/2021 and May/2022. The logical model and matrix of KMC indicators were developed and validated using the Delphi Method: semi-structured interviews were carried out with professionals from the KNICU team and the municipal child health coordination. It was considered implemented when the criteria were met (from 100.0 to 80.0%); partially implemented (79.9 to 60.0%); incipient (59.9 to 40.0%) and not implemented (<or=39.9%). Results: the MC was partially implemented in both KNICU (79.0% both). The Structure dimension was implemented (84.0 and 97.0%) and the Process dimension, in the Education (70.0% both) and Management components, were partially implemented (61.0% and 78.0%), although the units claim that they do not share clinical objectives, exams and treatments and do not have an effective referral/counter-referral system. While Assistance was implemented in one unit (90.0%) and partially implemented in the other (75.0%). Conclusion: KNICU was partially implemented during the coronavirus pandemic in the two reference maternity hospitals, but with obstacles to integration with the third stage of the method.

N2  - Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health of mothers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after distance learning measures during the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, considering factors that may influence their well-being. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, the levels of burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, coping strategies, social support, and perceived changes in mental health among the mothers were assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale, and Global Rating of Change (GRC) scale. Furthermore, the mothers completed the Atilla Turgay Scale (T-DSM-IV-S) to evaluate their perceptions of their children's ADHD and behavioral problems. Results: Of the 72 mothers (mean age: 42.46±6.73 years, mean children age: 11.39±3.12 years), 50%, 44.4%, and 43.1% had depression symptoms, anxiety, and stress, respectively. According to the GRC, most mothers (67%) reported deterioration in mental well-being compared with the pre-pandemic period. The strongest correlations were between the subscales of T-DSM-IV-S and the total MBI score (r=0.51, p<0.001), DASS-21 score (r=0.35, p=0.003), and GRC score (r=-0.40, p=0.004), particularly with the inattention subscale. Child's attention deficit score, maternal education level, maladaptive coping level, and frequency of outdoor activities were identified as predictors of GRC. Conclusions: This study showed that the distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with deteriorated mental health among mothers of children with ADHD. The mother's maladaptive coping strategies, frequency of outdoor activities, education level, and attention deficit level were identified as independent predictors of deteriorated mental health in mothers.

N2  - Background: Bacterial lysates are known for having immunomodulatory properties and have been used mainly for the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, rigorous studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of bacterial lysates with various bacterial antigen components, preparation methods, administration routes and course of treatment. OM-85, an oral standardized lysate prepared by alkaline lysis of 21 strains from 8 species of common respiratory tract pathogens, is indicated as immunotherapy for prevention of recurrent RTIs and acute infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. OM-85 acts on multiple innate and adaptive immune targets and can restore type 1 helper T (Th1)/Th2 balance. Sporadic studies have shown advances in pharmacology and therapeutics of OM-85, and thus an update review is necessary. Methods: Literature was retrieved by searching PubMed, Web of science, Embase, CNKI, and Full Text Database of Chinese Medical Journals. Results: New roles of OM-85 were discovered in prevention and treatment of lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, SARS-CoV-2 infection, allergic rhinitis, pulmonary fibrosis, atopic dermatitis, and nephrotic syndrome. Pharmacoeconomic values of OM-85 were demonstrated in prophylaxis and treatment of RTIs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic bronchitis, rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis. Two consecutive courses of OM-85 (6 or 12 months apart) could prevent recurrent RTIs in children. Maternal OM-85 treatment could offer benefits for offspring. Product-specific response was observed. The efficacy of OM-85 may be associated with patient’s characteristics (eg, severity of the disease, age, immune response pattern, malignancy risk stratification). Conclusion: OM-85 can improve effectiveness of standard care for some primary diseases, and carry significant pharmacoeconomic implications. The benefits shown by OM-85 in vitro and in vivo, when extrapolated to humans, are exciting but also require caution. Individualized treatment may need to be considered. It is necessary to compare the efficacy and safety of various bacterial lysate preparations.

N2  - Objectives: to evaluate patients’ satisfaction of mixed prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Lima, Peru. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of satisfaction in patients receiving mixed prenatal care that includes in-person and virtual visits. All women who gave a written consent between June and July 2021 were included. The survey was based on the Short Assessment of Patient Satisfaction (SAPS) scale which evaluated seven dimensions of satisfaction: access and facilities, effectiveness, information, technical skills, participation, relationship, and general satisfaction. Results: the overall satisfaction on mixed prenatal care was 3.28 ± 0.71. The mean SAPS score was 33.88 (SD = 5.56). In total, 144 patients (65%) preferred the mixed prenatal care. The mean maternal age of 221 included pregnant women was 30 years and the mean gestational age at the first appointment was 24 weeks. Overall, 88.2% of patients had up to 6 visits among virtual and in-person. Patients with non-health insurance had lower rates of satisfaction when compared with pregnant women with national health insurance (p=0.026). Conclusions: women receiving the mixed prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a high level of satisfaction. In general, pregnant women would recommend mixed prenatal care.

N2  - Background: Rates of perinatal depression and anxiety increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced risk perception and help-seeking behaviours among pregnant and postpartum individuals. Objectives: To explore pregnant and postpartum individuals’ decision-making process about when and how to seek support for feelings of depression and/or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Methods: The current study is a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected for a larger mixed-methods project that recruited participants who gave birth from 1 May 2020, to 1 December 2021, in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada, using maximum variation and purposive sampling. Seventy-three semi-structured interviews were conducted over Zoom or telephone. This analysis focuses on 56 individuals who discussed their self-identified feelings of prenatal or postpartum depression and/or anxiety. Conventional (inductive) content analysis was employed with iterative stages of open coding, focused coding and cross-checking themes. Results: Most participants recognized their need to seek help for their feelings of depression and/or anxiety through discussions with a mental health professional or someone within their social circle. Nearly all participants accessed informal social support for these feelings, which sometimes entailed social contact in contravention of local COVID-19 public health policies. Many also attempted to access formal mental healthcare, encountering barriers both related and unrelated to the pandemic. Participants described the pandemic as having the dual effect of causing or exacerbating their feelings of depression and/or anxiety while also constraining their ability to access timely professional care. Conclusion: Participants struggled to address their feelings of perinatal depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many describing a lack of readily available resources and limited access to professional mental healthcare. This study highlights the need for improved provision of instrumental mental health support for pregnant and postpartum populations.

N2  - Objectives: Public health emergencies can elevate the risk for intimate partner violence (IPV). Our objectives were 2-fold: first, to assess the prevalence of physical IPV and increased aggression from a husband or partner that occurred during pregnancy and was perceived to be due to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, to examine associations between these experiences and (1) COVID-19–related stressors and (2) postpartum outcomes. Methods: We used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System that were collected in 29 US jurisdictions among individuals with a live birth in 2020. We estimated the prevalence of violence during pregnancy by demographic characteristics and COVID-19–related stressors. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) to examine associations of physical IPV or increased aggression with COVID-19–related stressors, postpartum outcomes, and infant birth outcomes. Results: Among 14 154 respondents, 1.6% reported physical IPV during pregnancy, and 3.1% reported increased aggression by a husband or partner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents experiencing any economic, housing, or childcare COVID-19–related stressors reported approximately twice the prevalence of both types of violence as compared with those without COVID-19–related stressors. Physical IPV and increased aggression were associated with a higher prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms (APRs, 1.73 and 2.28, respectively) and postpartum cigarette smoking (APRs, 1.74 and 2.19). Physical IPV was associated with a lower prevalence of attending postpartum care visits (APR, 1.84). Conclusions: Our findings support the need for ongoing efforts to prevent IPV during pregnancy and to ensure the availability of resources during public health emergencies.

N2  - Under processes of responsibilisation and individualisation in the ‘risk society’, as well as discourses of intensive motherhood, mothers are expected to make ‘good’ decisions regarding their children’s health. Consequently, decision-making concerning childhood vaccination becomes an emotionally challenging process, as mothers strive to minimise risk while simultaneously promoting and protecting health. Existing research shows that a substantial number of parents of young children have concerns regarding childhood vaccination. This article aims to examine how mothers who identify as vaccine hesitant dynamically construct risk, emotion, and responsibility when accounting for their decisions about childhood vaccination. Based on 15 in-depth interviews conducted in Belgium, this article reports the findings of a discourse analysis. For the latter, we draw on positioning theory and Lupton’s emotion-risk assemblage. The findings report three storylines that mothers discursively construct when discussing risk and responsibility in relation to childhood vaccination, namely a health promotion, a maternal protection and a critical healthcare consumer storyline. These storylines help to clarify the fluid and multidimensional nature of the mothers’ accounts of vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, the findings provide empirical evidence for the use of the emotion-risk assemblage, as we find that vaccine hesitant mothers construct risk in relation to feelings of safety, control, empowerment, anxiety, fear, worry, intuition, vulnerability, being overwhelmed, pity and contempt. Overall, the findings demonstrate that when accounting for their decisions concerning childhood vaccination, hesitant mothers assume responsibilities within a context of social and gendered vulnerability, which affects their constructions of risk.

N2  - Introduction: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a major global contributor to morbidity and mortality. The susceptibility and outcome of RVIs are strongly age-dependent and show considerable inter-population differences, pointing to genetically and/or environmentally driven developmental variability. The factors determining the age-dependency and shaping the age-related changes of human anti-RVI immunity after birth are still elusive. Methods: We are conducting a prospective birth cohort study aiming at identifying endogenous and environmental factors associated with the susceptibility to RVIs and their impact on cellular and humoral immune responses against the influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The MIAI birth cohort enrolls healthy, full-term neonates born at the University Hospital Würzburg, Germany, with follow-up at four defined time-points during the first year of life. At each study visit, clinical metadata including diet, lifestyle, sociodemographic information, and physical examinations, are collected along with extensive biomaterial sampling. Biomaterials are used to generate comprehensive, integrated multi-omics datasets including transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic and microbiomic methods. Discussion: The results are expected to capture a holistic picture of the variability of immune trajectories with a focus on cellular and humoral key players involved in the defense of RVIs and the impact of host and environmental factors thereon. Thereby, MIAI aims at providing insights that allow unraveling molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to promote the development of competent anti-RVI immunity in early life and prevent severe RVIs.

N2  - Objective: Treatment adherence is crucial for the success of growth hormone (GH) therapy. Reported non-adherence rates in GH treatment have varied widely. Several factors may have an impact on adherence. Apart from these factors, the global impact of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including problems with hospital admission and routine follow-up of patients using GH treatment, may have additionally affected the adherence rate. The primary objective of this study was to investigate adherence to treatment in patients receiving GH. In addition, potential problems with GH treatment during the pandemic were investigated. Methods: This was a multicenter survey study that was sent to pediatric endocrinologists during the pandemic period (June-December 2021). Patient data, diagnosis, history of pituitary surgery, current GH doses, duration of GH therapy, the person administering therapy (either parent/patient), duration of missed doses, reasons for missed doses, as well as problems associated with GH therapy, missed dose data and the causes in the recent year (after the onset of the pandemic) were questioned. Treatment adherence was categorized based on missed dose rates over the past month (0 to 5%, full adherence; 5.1 to 10% moderate adherence; >10% non-adherence). Results: The study cohort consisted of 427 cases (56.2% male) from thirteen centers. Median age of diagnosis was 8.13 (0.13-16) years. Treatment indications were isolated GH deficiency (61.4%), multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (14%), Turner syndrome (7.5%), idiopathic GH deficiency (7.5%), small for gestational age (2.8%), and “others“ (6.8%). GH therapy was administered by parents in 70% and by patients in 30%. Mean daily dose was 32.3 µg/kg, the annual growth rate was 1.15 standard deviation score (minimum-2.74, maximum 9.3). Overall GH adherence rate was good in 70.3%, moderate in 14.7%, and poor in 15% of the patients. The reasons for non-adherence were mainly due to forgetfulness, being tired, inability to access medication, and/or pen problems. It was noteworthy that there was a negative effect on adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic reported by 22% of patients and the main reasons given were problems obtaining an appointment, taking the medication, and anxiety about going to hospital. There was no difference between genders in the adherence rate. Non-adherence to GH treatment decreased significantly when the patient: administered the treatment; was older; had longer duration of treatment; and during the pandemic. There was a non-significant decrease in annual growth rate as non-adherence rate increased. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the poor adherence rate was 15%, and duration of GH therapy and older age were important factors. There was a negative effect on adherence during the pandemic period.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal mental health problems are associated with morbidity for the pregnant person, and their infants are at long-term risk for poor health outcomes. We aim to explore how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected the mental health of pregnant people in the United Kingdom (UK), and to further identify resilience factors which may have contributed to varying mental health outcomes. We also aim to examine the quality of antenatal care provided during the pandemic in the UK and to identify potential inadequacies to enhance preparedness for future events. Methods: During June-November 2020, we recruited 3666 individuals in the UK for the EPPOCH pregnancy cohort (Maternal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Effect of the Pandemic on Pregnancy Outcomes and Childhood Health). Participants were assessed for depression, anxiety, anger and pregnancy-related anxiety using validated scales. Additionally, physical activity, social support, individualized support and personal coping ability of the respondents were assessed as potential resilience factors. Results: Participants reported high levels of depression (57.05%), anxiety (58.04%) and anger (58.05%). Higher levels of social and individualized support and personal coping ability were associated with lower mental health challenges. Additionally, pregnant individuals in the UK experienced higher depression during the pandemic than that reported in Canada. Finally, qualitative analysis revealed that restrictions for partners and support persons during medical appointments as well as poor public health communication led to increased mental health adversities and hindered ability to make medical decisions. Discussion: This study revealed increased mental health challenges among pregnant individuals in the UK during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results highlight the need for reassessing the mental health support measures available to pregnant people in the UK, both during times of crisis and in general.

N2  - Viral infections are increasingly recognized as triggers for depressive disorders, particularly following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the rise of long COVID. Viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are linked to depression through complex neurobiological mechanisms. These include immune system dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and neurotransmitter imbalances that affect brain function and mood regu-lation. Viral activation of the immune system leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in neuroinflammation and associated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, specific viruses can disrupt neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, all of which are essential for mood stabilization. The unique interactions of different viruses with these systems underscore the need for virus-specific therapeutic approaches. Current broad-spectrum treatments often overlook the precise neurobiological pathways involved in post-viral depression, reducing their efficacy. This review emphasizes the need to understand these virus-specific interactions to create tailored interventions that directly address the neurobiological effects induced by each type of virus. These interventions may include immunomodulatory treatments that target persistent inflammation, antiviral therapies to reduce the viral load, or neuroprotective strategies that restore neurotransmitter balance. Precision medicine offers promising avenues for the effective management of virus-induced depression, providing patient-specific approaches that address the specific biological mechanisms involved. By focusing on the development of these targeted treatments, this review aims to pave the way for a new era in psychiatric care that fully addresses the root causes of depression induced by viral infec-tions.

N2  - Objective: The 2020 Family First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) extended Medicaid coverage for enrollees without rechecking eligibility. Before that, women were eligible for Medicaid coverage up to 60 days postpartum. We examine the FFCRA's effect on Medicaid postpartum coverage, depression symptoms, and birth control use beyond 60 days after delivery. Data Sources and Setting: We use data from the 2016–2021 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). The primary sample includes 56,828 women who were income eligible up to 60 days postpartum or beyond in their state. Study Design: We employ a difference-in-differences design comparing outcomes before and after the FFCRA between women who were not income eligible for Medicaid coverage beyond 60 days postpartum in their state and those who were income eligible. We estimate models without and with controlling for state-specific trends in outcomes over time. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: N/A. Principal Findings: There is an 8.1 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of having Medicaid coverage without controlling for state-specific trends, and 5.4 percentage-points when controlling for state-specific trends (both p < 0.05). There is a decline in likelihood of being uninsured by 3 percentage-points (p < 0.05) without state-specific trends and a smaller and non-significant decline when including state-specific trends. Estimated effects on depression symptoms and birth control use are small and statistically non-significant. Conclusion: Following the FFCRA, there was an increase in Medicaid coverage beyond 60 days postpartum among women who would have been income ineligible for Medicaid after 60 days. However, there is a less pronounced effect on likelihood of being uninsured, which might be partly due to some switching from private to Medicaid coverage. There were no discernable effects on depression symptoms and birth control use. Examining additional health and health care utilization measures over a longer postpartum period is needed to further understand the FCCRA effects on these outcomes.

N2  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced people to make major life changes, and there is concern that depressive tendencies have increased in pregnant women during the pandemic. This study used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), administered in the second trimester, to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of Japanese women during pregnancy and to provide early intervention. Methods: The study included 1,320 pregnant women (663 pre-COVID-19 and 657 during COVID-19) with similar background characteristics and compared the results for the COVID-19 period (September 2020-August 2021) and control period (September 2018-August 2019). Women treated for psychiatric disorders were excluded. The EPDS cutoff score was 13. Results: The median EPDS scores were 3 (1-6) points during the control period and 3 (1-5) points during the pandemic (p = 0.166) for the control and pandemic periods. Fourteen patients (2.1%) during the control period and 20 (3.0%) during the pandemic scored ≥13 points; however, the difference was not significant (odds ratio, 1.455; 95% confidence interval: 0.692-3.143). Conclusions: COVID-19 did not change mid-pregnancy EPDS scores at a single Japanese center.

N2  - Purpose: The peripartum is a time of increased risk for the development or worsening of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Existing evidence suggests that OC symptoms commonly surge immediately postpartum followed by a gradual recovery. Yet how societal conditions, such as a widespread public health crisis, may affect this pattern remains unknown. Increased OC symptom prevalence in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the pre-existing vulnerability of peripartum women suggests they may have been at particularly high risk for sustained symptoms. Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine trajectories in OC symptoms, particularly contamination concerns, in women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to look at risk and resiliency factors that may influence symptom course Methods: A sample of 164 US pregnant women were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. They reported OC symptoms at 3 timepoints: April/May, 2020, July, 2020, and February, 2022. We used a growth mixture modeling approach to examine OC symptom trajectories from pregnancy through the postpartum across these timepoints, comparing the goodness of fit of models with 1–5 trajectory classes for overall OC symptoms and for contamination-related OC symptoms. Results: For total OC symptoms, two classes of trajectories were identified: recovering (29.27%) versus stable low (70.73%) symptoms; for contamination symptoms alone, a subset of total symptoms, three trajectories were identified: recovering (8.54%), stable low symptoms (68.29%), and stable high symptoms (23.17%). Peripartum stress, but not sociodemographic or obstetric factors, predicted class membership. Conclusions: These findings suggest that peripartum OC symptoms, particularly related to contamination, may persist beyond the postpartum period in some women, particularly for women exposed to elevated stress in pregnancy and the postpartum.

N2  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), hospitalization, and mortality in infants and young children globally. The greatest burden of severe disease and mortality occurs in low-middle income countries (LMICs), with large and vulnerable childhood populations. The highest rates of RSV-hospitalization occur in healthy-term infants under 3 months of age. Preterm infants, children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, Down's syndrome, congenital heart disease, or immunodeficiency also have a higher risk of severe RSV-LRTI. Early-life RSV-LRTI has also been associated with chronic sequelae, including recurrent LRTI, recurrent wheezing, asthma, and lung function impairment. A RSV pre-fusion (F) maternal vaccine and long-acting monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) have been licensed for the prevention of RSV-LRTI in infants and young children. Studies show high efficacy and effectiveness particularly for preventing severe RSV-LRTI. Maternal RSV vaccine given at 24–36 weeks of pregnancy was effective in preventing RSV medically attended LRTI and severe RSV-LRTI through 6 months after birth in a phase 3 study conducted in 18 countries over two RSV seasons. Vaccination was safe with no significant difference in adverse events between infants born to mothers who received RSV preF vaccine compared to placebo. A numerical imbalance in preterm births that occurred predominantly in South Africa, unrelated to vaccine timing or gestational age at vaccination and unassociated with mortality, coincided with COVID-19 delta and omicron waves. Nirsevimab, given as a single dose prior or during the RSV season, had high efficacy in preventing RSV-LRTI hospitalization in infants in preterm and in full-term infants, as well as in young children with underlying conditions through 150 days post administration in phase 2 and 3 trials. High effectiveness against hospitalization or severe disease in infants and in at-risk children up to 2 years of age has also been reported in several countries where implementation has occurred. RSV-LRTI is now a preventable disease in infants and young children. Rapid implementation of these highly effective interventions has occurred in many high-income countries, but access remains very limited in LMICs. Access to such RSV preventive interventions is urgently needed for all children to strengthen child health and promote global equity.

N2  - Maternal immunization (MI) is an emerging strategy to combat infant mortality in low-income (LIC) and lower-middle income countries (LMIC). We conducted a systematic review to identify the facilitators and barriers to MI and strategies that improve uptake in LICs and LMICs. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies published in English from January 1, 2011, to October 31, 2021, from all LICs and LMICs. Data was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 55 studies were included. The major barriers were low knowledge and concern of vaccine safety among pregnant women and healthcare providers (HCP). HCP’s recommendation, maternal knowledge, vaccine confidence and ≥4 antenatal care (ANC) visits facilitated uptake. The key strategies encompassed health financing, reminders, intersectoral coordination, integration, community engagement, capacity building, and education. Community-based delivery models were effective. Tailored programs are needed to improve ANC access, and educate pregnant women and HCPs.

N2  - Objective: To assess occupational burnout conditions and work-related factors among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyse the relationships among these factors utilizing the job demands–resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework. Methods: An online survey was distributed to medical staff in one city via convenience sampling during 12/29/2022–1/10/2023. Path analysis was utilized to explore the relationship between work-related factors and occupational burnout among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Among 474 respondents, 455 frontline medical staff (female=79.56%) were included in the final analysis. Medical staff aged <35 exhibited higher levels of occupational burnout than did older staff. Depression/anxiety and workload were positively correlated with occupational burnout and negatively correlated with self-compassion, workplace health/safety, and workplace support. Path analysis indicated the direct effects of workplace support, depression/anxiety, workplace health/safety, self-compassion, and workload on occupational burnout. There were also partial mediating effects of workplace support, depression/anxiety, workplace health/safety, and self-compassion on occupational burnout. The model demonstrated good fit. Conclusion: Workplace support, a crucial job resource, can improve occupational burnout among frontline medical staff in various ways. Reducing anxiety, depression, and workload and improving workplace support, health/safety, and self-compassion are practical and effective measures for mitigating occupational burnout.

N2  - Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, birthing parents were identified as a high-risk group with greater vulnerability to the harms associated with SARS-CoV-2. This led to necessary changes in perinatal health policies but also to experiences of maternal isolation and loneliness, both in hospital settings, due to infection mitigation procedures, and once home, due to social distancing. Methods: In this study, we qualitatively explored birthing and postpartum experiences in New York City during the early days of the pandemic when lockdowns were in effect and policies and practices were rapidly changing. Using thematic analysis, our focus was on experiences of isolation, navigating these experiences, and the potential impacts of isolation and loneliness on maternal health for 55 birthing people. Results: Participants described numerous stressors related to isolation during the birthing process, including reconciling their hopes for their birth with the realities of the unknown and separation from partners, family, and friends in the hospital. During the postpartum period, loneliness manifested as having limited or no contact with family and friends, which led to feelings of a need for strengthened social support systems. The impact of these negative experiences shaped mental health. Overall, we found that solitary experiences during birthing and postpartum isolation were major sources of stress for participants in this study. Discussion: To support impacted families and prepare for future crisis events, clinicians and researchers must prioritize the development of strong clinical and social support structures for perinatal people to ensure both maternal and child health.

N2  - Maternal COVID-19 infection increases the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring, although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. This study demonstrated that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy disrupted the balance of maternal and fetal immune environments, driving alterations in astrocytes, endothelial cells, and excitatory neurons. A risk score was established using 47 unique genes in the single-cell transcriptome of gestational mothers. The high risk score in CD4 proliferating T cell level served as an indicator for increased risk of offspring NDDs. Summary-based Mendelian randomization and phenome-wide association study analyses were conducted to identify the causal association of the transcriptional changes with the increased risk of offspring NDDs. Additionally, 10 drugs were identified as potential therapeutic candidates. Our findings support a model where the maternal COVID-19 infection changed the levels of CD4 proliferating T cells, leading to the alterations of astrocytes, endothelial cells, and excitatory neurons in offspring, contributing to the increased risk of NDDs in these individuals.

N2  - Dyadic interventions targeting maternal mental health and the mother-infant relationship in the perinatal period are critical due to the potential consequences of perinatal mental illness and relational disturbance for the mother, the infant, and their family. This paper describes the Pregnancy to Parenthood (P2P) model of care, a dyadic mother-infant community-based program designed to support vulnerable families in Western Australia in the context of an identified need to build workforce capacity. A pragmatic service evaluation study was conducted by analyzing routine clinical data collected from 105 dyads who completed pre- and post-intervention measures, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS), and the Mother Object Relations Scale-Short Form (MORS-SF). Reliable change index and cut-off analyses indicated a clinically reliable pre-post reduction in perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms for 71% and 68% of the sample, respectively. Significant pre-post improvements with medium effect sizes (r = −.46, r = −.32) were found for caregiving representations on the MORS-SF, suggesting representations became more balanced. These results provide provisional evidence that the P2P model of care may be effective in improving maternal mental health and caregiving representations. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of P2P in relation to enhancing family well-being, and to inform policy and mental health service development.

N2  - By the end of 2023, it appeared that SARS-CoV-2 was being controlled, although its JN.1 variant was infecting more easily, with hospitalizations of older adults and the unvaccinated, but few deaths. Now some light is emerging on Long COVID, how the sequelae affect vital organs and why they persist in a significant number of people. Unfortunately, the brain is one of the most affected organs. Hence, the need for vaccines. We consider this update important as we begin 2024, recognizing the work of Eric Topol as a science communicator who provides a variety of information on what is happening with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Regarding what we have learned, apart from preparing ourselves for future pandemics, we consider it important to avoid loneliness, seek emotional support, practice virtuality and telemedicine, be creative, wash our hands, use masks to protect us from airborne pathogens and support vaccines.

N2  - Background: During the peak of the epidemic, hospitalized patients frequently encountered significant health risks and potentially life-threatening circumstances, including uncertainty regarding treatment and the potential for complications. Objective: The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among hospitalized patients 3 months after discharge during the first peak of the epidemic, and the association of PTSD with disease-related characteristics. Design: A single-center and full-sample follow-up study was conducted on COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, China. Data were collected during their hospitalization and 3 months after discharge. Methods: PTSD symptoms were evaluated by primary care post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD), a total score of 3 or above was considered as clinically significant PTSD symptoms. Demographic and disease-related characteristics were collected to identify related associations with PTSD symptoms. Results: A total of 903 patients completed the follow-up survey, yielding a response rate of 63.5%. A total of 212 (23.5%) of the patients were positive in PC-PTSD screening. Univariate regression analysis identified several factors correlated with PTSD symptoms, including female gender, younger age, a lower body mass index (BMI), preexisting sleep problems, bereavement due to COVID-19, a severe clinical diagnosis, the presence of three or more clinical symptoms at disease onset, and residual respiratory symptoms after discharge. Notably, in the multivariate regression analysis, experiencing three or more clinical symptoms at onset emerged as a robust predictor of PTSD symptoms (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.48–2.95). An intriguing finding was that patients who underwent radiological assessment post-discharge reported a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms, whereas those who underwent re-testing for IgG or IgM antibodies exhibited a lower prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Three months post-recovery, PTSD symptoms prevalence among COVID-19 patients was 23.5%. Those with three or more clinical symptoms at onset or residual respiratory symptoms post-discharge showed higher risk. These findings highlighted the long-term effect of COVID-19 on mental health, urging enhanced attention and interventions for survivors.

N2  - Aims and method This cross-sectional study, carried out from 2021 to 2022, investigated the factors associated with domestic violence in 400 Brazilian pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Violence was assessed with the World Health Organization's Violence Against Women questionnaire and the Abuse Assessment Screen. Demographic, socioeconomic, obstetric, lifestyle and mental health data were collected. Results Violence at any time in their lives was reported by 52.2% of the women, and psychological violence was the most prevalent type (19.5%). Violence was associated with being single and mental health changes. Pregnant women exposed to any lifetime violence and psychological violence were, respectively, 4.67 and 5.93 times more likely to show mental health changes compared with women with no reported violence. Clinical implications Training health professionals involved in prenatal care in the early detection of single women and women with mental health changes could be important in preventing domestic violence.

N2  - Background. The COVID‑19 pandemic had a profound effect on the health sector globally and in South Africa (SA). Objective. To review the effects of COVID‑19 on maternal, perinatal and reproductive health outcomes and service utilisation in SA. Methods. Three routine national data collection systems were sourced: the District Health Information System, the Saving Mothers reports of the National Committee on Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths and the Saving Babies reports from the National Perinatal Morbidity and Mortality Committee using data from the Perinatal Problem Identification Program. Results. There were 35% and 8% increases in maternal and stillbirth mortality rates, respectively, in 2020 and 2021, which correlated with the COVID‑19 waves. However, in 2022, rates returned to pre‑COVID levels. Antenatal visits and facility births showed little change, but there was a shift to more rural provinces. The use of oral and injectable contraceptives and termination of pregnancy services decreased markedly in 2020 and 2021, with a sustained shift to long‑acting reversible contraceptives. The increase in maternal deaths was predominantly due to COVID‑19 respiratory complications, but also an increase in obstetric haemorrhage. Stillbirths increased significantly (10%) for birthweights between 2 000 g and 2 499 g, categorised mostly as unexplained stillbirths or preterm labour, but no increase in neonatal deaths was observed. Administrative avoidable factors increased by 24% in the 2020 ‑ 2022 triennium, but there was no increase in patient/community level or healthcare provider‑related avoidable factors during the pandemic years. Conclusion. COVID‑19 caused a marked increase in maternal death and stillbirth rates in 2020 and 2021 due to both direct effects of the virus and indirect effects on functioning of the health system. The continued, although modified, health‑seeking behaviour of women and the rapid return to pre‑COVID‑19 mortality rates demonstrates enormous resilience in women and the health system.

N2  - Phosphodiesterase enzyme 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have emerged as one of the leading molecules for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). PDE5 inhibitors are categorized structurally into several classes. PDE5 inhibitors have been a multidisciplinary endeavor that attracts the attention of researchers because of their multiple pharmaceutical applications. Beyond their action on ED, PDE5 inhibitors are widely used in treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), Eisenmenger’s syndrome, Raynaud’s Disease, Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), Mountain sickness, Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC), pulmonary arterial hypertension and type II diabetes (insulin resistance). In addition, PDE5 inhibitors also show promising antiproliferative activity, anti-Alzheimer and COX-1/COX-2 inhibitory activity (anti-inflammatory). Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacogenetics and toxicity of PDE5 inhibitors were finally explored. The diverse therapeutic applications, the high feasibility of structural modification and the appropriate pharmacokinetic properties of PDE5 inhibitors have motivated researchers to develop new scaffolds that have been either under clinical trials or approved by FDA and utilize them to overcome some recent global concerns, such as COVID-19.

N2  - Introduction: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state of Florida became the epicenter of the COVID-19 delta variant during the summer of 2021. There is limited knowledge on how the pandemic impacted postpartum women's lived experiences in the United States. The purpose of the study was to explore the lived experiences of postpartum women living in South Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic and their responses. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study design was used. Study participants included 26 postpartum women living in South Florida who had given birth to a live newborn from March 2020 to May 2022. We used purposeful sampling and social media recruitment methods. Sociodemographic information was collected using REDCap, and live face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted on Webex using a semistructured questionnaire. Content analysis was used to analyze the research data and develop themes and subthemes. Results: The first central theme, raising an infant during a pandemic, included 3 subthemes: (1) protecting the infant, (2) feeling isolated, and (3) food for thought. The second central theme, maternal needs during a pandemic, included 3 subthemes: (1) mental health needs, (2) support needs, and (3) health care needs. Conclusion: Findings suggest women experienced significant challenges in caring for themselves and their infants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the need for policy reform that secures comprehensive and quality postpartum health care for women that includes mental health screenings.

N2  - Fetal death is defined as the spontaneous cessation of cardiac activity after 14 weeks gestational age (GA). Regarding prevention of fetal death in the general population, it is not recommended to counsel or prescribe rest, aspirin, vitamin A, vitamin D, or micronutrient supplementation; systematically look for nuchal cord during prenatal screening ultrasound; or perform systematic antepartum monitoring by cardiotocography for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of fetal death. It is recommended to offer vaccination against influenza in epidemic periods and against SARS-CoV-2. Regarding evaluation in the event of fetal death, it is recommended that a fetal autopsy and anatomopathologic examination of the placenta be performed; chromosomal analysis be performed by microarray testing, rather than by conventional karyotype (with postnatal sampling of the fetal placental surface preferred for genetic purposes); testing for antiphospholipid antibodies be performed, with systematic Kleihauer–Betke testing and for irregular agglutinins; and summary consultation to discuss these examination results be offered. Regarding announcement and support, it is recommended that fetal death be announced without ambiguity, using simple words adapted to each situation, after which the couple should be supported with empathy across the different stages of their care. Regarding patient management in cases of fetal death, it is recommended that: in the absence of risks for disseminated intravascular coagulation or maternal demise, the patient's wishes regarding the timing between the fetal death diagnosis and labor induction should be considered; return home is possible, according to the patient's wishes; in all situations except maternal life-threatening emergencies, the preferred mode of delivery is vaginal, regardless of previous cesarean section(s); mifepristone 200 mg be prescribed at least 24 h before induction; and perimedullary analgesia be initiated at the start of induction if requested by the patient, regardless of GA. Of note, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either the administration route (i.e., vaginal or oral) of misoprostol or prostaglandin type. Regarding the risk of recurrence after unexplained fetal death: the incidence does not appear to be increased in subsequent pregnancies; in cases with a history of fetal death due to vascular problems, low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce perinatal morbidity (otherwise, evidence is insufficient to recommend the prescription of aspirin); no optimal delay in initiating another pregnancy should be recommended based solely on a history of fetal death; fetal heart rate monitoring is not indicated based solely on a history of fetal death; although systematic labor induction is not recommended, induction may be considered depending on the context and parental request, and considering fetal age, benefits, and risks, especially before 39 weeks GA. Note that if the cause of fetal death is identified, management should be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Regarding fetal death in a twin pregnancy, it is recommended that the surviving twin be examined immediately upon fetal death diagnosis; in a dichorionic twin pregnancy, preterm delivery induction is not recommended; in a monochorionic twin pregnancy, the surviving twin should be immediately evaluated for signs of acute fetal anemia, with weekly ultrasound monitoring for the first month, though immediate labor induction is not recommended.

N2  - Objective: This research was conducted to determine the anxiety levels, postpartum support needs, and the levels of received support in puerperae during the pandemic period. Material and Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out between April and August 2020 at the Postpartum Service of the Gynecology and Children’s Diseases Training and Research Hospital on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Three hundred postpartum mothers who met the sampling criteria and volunteered to participate were included in the study. Data were collected using a survey form containing the participants’ demographic, individual, and obstetric characteristics, their opinions on the COVID-19 process, the Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS), and the Postpartum Support Scale (PSS). Results: It was determined that the average Beck Anxiety Scale score of the participants was 13.71±11.21, and 55% of them experienced moderate postpartum anxiety. The total Postpartum Support Scale mean score regarding the importance of support for the puerperae was calculated as 149.65±47.50, and the support received related to this need was found to be 118.32±48.58. Conclusion: It was determined that women experienced postpartum anxiety at a moderate level, needed considerable support during this period, but did not receive much support.

N2  - Introduction: Prematurity is a factor that contributes to the increase in infant morbidity and mortality and is associated with factors determining child growth, such as nutritional deficits, mainly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To evaluate the factors determining the growth of premature neonates treated at a secondary health service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Observational retrospective and prospective cohort study of premature patients followed at the follow-up clinic in the municipality of Carapicuíba from February 2020 to December 2023. Through a review of medical records, anthropometric data were collected from birth to corrected gestational age, approximately six months, and nutritional and non-nutritional data with direct or indirect influence on growth. Statistical analysis with tests for quantitative and qualitative variables was carried out with the SPSS Statistics software version 27.0 (SPSS et al., USA). Result: The study analyzed a sample of 302 newborns, predominantly male (51.7%) and classified as moderately preterm (47.4%), with an average gestational age of 32.4 ± 2.8 weeks. Prenatal complications occurred in 59.3% of cases, while neonatal complications, such as extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR, 30.8%) and use of parenteral nutrition (36.1%), were common, with an average hospital stay of 30.2 ± 26.1 days. Most newborns were artificially fed (51%) Moreover, they received multivitamins (71.9%). At six months, the newborns showed healthy growth with an average weight of 6.718.2 ± 1.346.5 g. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant associations between EUGR and negative Z scores for weight, length, and head circumference at six months. Complications such as anemia and congenital abnormalities also negatively impacted these scores. Comparatively, the newborns in the group pre-vaccination against COVID-19 had more significant growth at six months and more prevalence of newborns born large for gestational age (LGA), while complications such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and viral bronchiolitis was more common in the post-vaccination group. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-nutritional factors, especially EUGR, significantly influenced the anthropometry of premature babies. This condition highlighted the need for more effective therapeutic strategies and public health measures to improve the growth and development of premature infants.

N2  - Introduction: The US maternity care system achieves worse outcomes for birthing people identifying as Black versus White. Assessment of fetal well-being in labor is an area of perinatal care subject to significant interobserver variability and therefore may be at particular risk of medical racism influencing care. Methods: Statewide collaborative quality initiative data, focused on decreasing the nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) cesarean birth rate, were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study to assess differences in cesarean birth for nonreassuring fetal status between birthing people identifying as Black compared with White. Generalized linear mixed modeling with hospital as a random intercept was used for multivariate analyses accounting for birthing people clustering within hospitals. Results: Between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, 69,622 births were identified, 8291 (11.9%) of which were an unplanned cesarean with a primary indication of nonreassuring fetal heart tracing (cesarean for FHT). Race and ethnicity were significantly associated with a higher risk, after controlling for covariates: compared with White birthing people, birthing people of unknown race or ethnicity had 1.23 (95% CI 1.13-1.35) and Asian Pacific Islander birthing people had 1.55 times the odds (95% CI 1.37-1.76), whereas Black birthing people had 1.71 times the odds (95% CI 1.59-1.83) of birthing via unplanned cesarean for FHT. In adjusted analysis, prepregnancy diabetes, positive COVID-19 status at admission, elevated body mass index, and birthing in the Detroit Metro area were associated with cesarean for FHT. In an unplanned subgroup analysis of births within the Detroit Metro region, Black individuals remained significantly more likely to have an unplanned cesarean for FHT (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.48-1.79). Discussion: After controlling for individual and hospital-level factors, cesarean for FHT was more common among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White birthing people in this statewide cohort of NTSV births.

N2  - Background: Prevention of alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) involves reducing risky alcohol consumption among women at-risk for pregnancy, using effective contraception among women drinking at risky levels to prevent pregnancy, or both. This study presents the outcomes of a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of Native CHOICES, a culturally tailored adaptation of the CHOICES intervention, among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women. Methods: AI/AN women aged 18–44 who were at-risk for an AEP were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the Native CHOICES intervention or a waitlist control group. Native CHOICES comprised two sessions of motivational interviewing and an elective contraception counseling session. Data were collected at baseline, and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postbaseline. Due to the pandemic, the intervention was at times delivered remotely. Results: A total of 404 women participated: 199 in the control group and 205 in the intervention group. Sixty-seven percent of the intervention group received the intervention in-person, and 33% participated by telephone or video call. Sixty-four percent of women completed all follow-up visits. At the six-month follow-up, the intervention did not demonstrate a significant impact on AEP risk compared with the control arm when analyzing all the data (RR = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.07). However, an exploratory subgroup analysis showed evidence of a reduction in AEP risk among participants who completed the study in-person before the COVID-19 pandemic (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.98), which was not observed during or after the pandemic (RR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.91–1.24). Conclusions: The Native CHOICES intervention did not show evidence of effectiveness overall. However, exploratory analyses offer some evidence that the intervention was effective prior to the pandemic.

N2  - Strength-based video-feedback (SB-VF) is an attached base and culturally sensitive video-feedback intervention which promotes maternal well-being and sensitivity through using mentalization technics. The goals of this study were to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of internet-delivered SB-VF to mother with post-partum depression during COVID-19 pandemic. A pilot randomized, two arm controlled trial was conducted (trial registration NCT04748731) with depressive symptoms’ women (n = 172) from Chilean public primary health centers, 79 were randomized to either experimental group (on-line SB-VF plus treatment as usual [TAU], n = 41) or control group (TAU, n = 38). Primary outcomes were feasibility measured by eligibility rate, recruitment rate and intervention completion, and acceptability measured by in depth interviews to mothers and therapists. Secondary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms, maternal sensitivity and parental reflective function. The study demonstrated favorable feasibility and acceptability. Despite moderate recruitment rates, the completion rate was notably high in comparison to other online interventions. Participants reported positive experiences, though some faced challenges with internet access and privacy. Maternal sensitivity improved in the intervention group with a small to large effect size. The SB-VF intervention is feasible and preliminarily effective in public health system, with potential for scaling up in similar contexts.

N2  - Background and purpose: Parents of preterm infants experience anxiety and stress in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Visitation restrictions due to COVID-19 have increased maternal pressure and limited bonding opportunities. Little research exists in Taiwan on using video conferencing as a solution. This study investigates depression and stress levels in mothers of preterm infants and evaluates the effectiveness of video visitation during NICU restrictions. Methods: This study adopts a cross-sectional design and a qualitative survey. Mothers of premature infants were recruited and they participated in the study. Interventions for video visits were scheduled on the third day of admission to the NICU (T1) and during the second week of the study (T2). After each video visit, participants completed an online survey. The study's online survey used structured questionnaires including demographics, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Parental Stress Scale (PSS): Infant Hospitalization (IH). Results: A total of 51 mothers of preterm infants participated in the study. During the T1 and T2 periods, single mothers with lower educational levels and those aged below 30 experienced depression and high levels of stress. Lower birth weight and gestational age were associated with maternal depression. Video visitation intervention led to a significant decrease in depression scores (EPDS, T1: 11.3 ± 5.5 vs. T2: 10.1 ± 5.2, p = 0.039). Positive correlations were observed between EPDS and PSS: IH scores (p < 0 .005). Conclusion: Video visitation intervention can reduce maternal depression in mothers with preterm infants. Since it is practical, video visitation may be applied even after the pandemic.

N2  - Drug discovery is challenging task with numerous obstacles in translating drug candidates into clinical products. Dendrimers are highly adaptable nanostructured polymers with significant potential to improve the chances of clinical success for drugs. Yet, dendrimer-based drug products are still in their infancy. However, Hydroxyl polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers showed significant promise in drug discovery efforts, owning their remarkable potential to selectively target and deliver drugs specifically to activated microglia and astrocytes at the site of brain injury in several preclinical models. After a decade's worth of academic research and pre-clinical efforts, the hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer-N-acetyl cysteine conjugate (OP-101) nanomedicine has made a significant advancement in the field of nanomedicine and targeted delivery. The OP-101 conjugate, primarily developed and validated in academic labs, has now entered clinical trials as a potential treatment for hyperinflammation in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 through Ashvattha Therapeutics. This chapter, we delve into the journey of the hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimer-N-acetylcysteine (NAC) OP-101 formulation from the laboratory to the clinic. It will specifically focus on the design, synthesis, preclinical, and clinical development of OP-101, highlighting the potential it holds for the future of medicine and the positive Phase 2a results for treating severe COVID-19.

N2  - Background: The increased pervasiveness of digital health technology is producing large amounts of person-generated health data (PGHD). These data can empower people to monitor their health to promote prevention and management of disease. Women make up one of the largest groups of consumers of digital self-tracking technology. Objective: In this scoping review, we aimed to (1) identify the different areas of women’s health monitored using PGHD from connected health devices, (2) explore personal metrics collected through these technologies, and (3) synthesize facilitators of and barriers to women’s adoption and use of connected health devices. Methods: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews, we searched 5 databases for articles published between January 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. Papers were included if they targeted women or female individuals and incorporated digital health tools that collected PGHD outside a clinical setting. Results: We included a total of 406 papers in this review. Articles on the use of PGHD for women steadily increased from 2015 to 2020. The health areas that the articles focused on spanned several topics, with pregnancy and the postpartum period being the most prevalent followed by cancer. Types of digital health used to collect PGHD included mobile apps, wearables, websites, the Internet of Things or smart devices, 2-way messaging, interactive voice response, and implantable devices. A thematic analysis of 41.4% (168/406) of the papers revealed 6 themes regarding facilitators of and barriers to women’s use of digital health technology for collecting PGHD: (1) accessibility and connectivity, (2) design and functionality, (3) accuracy and credibility, (4) audience and adoption, (5) impact on community and health service, and (6) impact on health and behavior. Conclusions: Leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of digital health tools to address women’s health concerns was on a steady rise. The prominence of tools related to pregnancy and the postpartum period reflects the strong focus on reproductive health in women’s health research and highlights opportunities for digital technology development in other women’s health topics. Digital health technology was most acceptable when it was relevant to the target audience, was seen as user-friendly, and considered women’s personalization preferences while also ensuring accuracy of measurements and credibility of information. The integration of digital technologies into clinical care will continue to evolve, and factors such as liability and health care provider workload need to be considered. While acknowledging the diversity of individual needs, the use of PGHD can positively impact the self-care management of numerous women’s health journeys. The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in increased adoption and acceptance of digital health technology. This study could serve as a baseline comparison for how this field has evolved as a result.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to viral pathogens has been known to cause the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. Furthermore, COVID-19 has been associated with a variety of neurological manifestations, raising the question of whether in utero SARS-CoV-2 exposure can affect neurodevelopment, resulting in long-lasting behavioral and cognitive deficits. Using a human ACE2–knock-in mouse model, we have previously shown that prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at later stages of development leads to fetal brain infection and gliosis in the hippocampus and cortex. In this study, we aimed to determine whether infection of the fetal brain results in long-term neuroanatomical alterations of the cortex and hippocampus or in any cognitive deficits in adulthood. Here, we show that infected mice developed slower and weighed less in adulthood. We also found altered hippocampal and amygdala volume and aberrant newborn neuron morphology in the hippocampus of adult mice infected in utero. Furthermore, we observed sex-dependent alterations in anxiety-like behavior and locomotion, as well as hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Taken together, our study reveals long-lasting neurological and cognitive changes as a result of prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying a window for early intervention and highlighting the importance of immunization and antiviral intervention in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction and objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), in case of inadequate glycaemic control, is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate data concerning outcomes of neonates born to mothers with GDM, treated with only diet (GDM G1) compared to diet and insulin therapy (GDM G2). Special consideration was given to data concerning outcomes of neonates born after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020. Materials and methods: Medical records were analysed. The data comprised records of newborns born at term or near term in the years 2017-2021. The statistical analysis was performed, with the significance level set at α = 0.05. Results: A total of 646 medical records were analysed. The study groups differed significantly (p < 0.05) in the length of hospitalisation, incidence of cardiological abnormalities, and method of feeding during hospitalisation. There were no differences (p > 0.05) between the groups in the results concerning neonatal anthropometric measurements, general condition after birth, or other perinatal outcomes. In 2020, significantly more (p < 0.05) neonates required support in their adaptation period. These neonates were more often (p < 0.05) diagnosed with birth defects and other complications. Conclusions: The level of maternal glycaemic control, appropriate medical care, and thus effectiveness of maternal treatment are important factors influencing neonatal outcomes and breastfeeding rates.

N2  - Importance: In Myanmar, amid political and civil unrest, droves of Burmese are displaced to neighboring countries including Thailand. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the available healthcare services and health and well-being among refugees and migrant workers within resettlement areas along the Myanmar-Thailand border. Objective: To explore the unmet needs of migrants along the Thailand-Myanmar border during the COVID-19 pandemic and their reasons for leaving Myanmar. Design: A qualitative study that used focus groups with migrant schoolteachers and school masters was undertaken. An interpretative analysis approach was used to analyze the data from the focus group sessions. The study followed the COREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative) checklist. Setting: In July 2022, community stakeholders from migrant schools located in the vicinity of Mae Sot, Thailand were referred to the study team. Participants: A purposive sample of 17 adult participants was recruited from 4 migrant schools. The participants were schoolteachers and schoolmasters who had traveled from Myanmar to Thailand 1 to 20 years ago. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Thematic analysis was used to scrutinize qualitative data for the outcomes of health and well-being, barriers, and reasons for migration. Results: Three main themes were identified: “issues related to the pandemic”, “teenage marriage and pregnancies” and "migration decisions". The issues related to the pandemic included behavior changes in children, a diminished quality of education, and barriers to receiving COVID-19 vaccines and accessing other health care. There were more dropouts due to teenage pregnancy/marriage during the shelter in place mandate. Migration decisions were affected by concerns over health, civil unrest, and military harassment. Conclusions and Relevance: This study presented the difficulties experienced by Myanmar migrants currently living along the Thailand-Myanmar border. The reasons for leaving Myanmar included health and safety. Suspending education during the pandemic caused more school dropouts due to teenage pregnancy/marriage. Additionally, behavioral changes in children, a diminished quality of education, barriers to receiving COVID-19 vaccines and access to other health care services were reported. Future studies should focus on how migration stress and access to mental health care impact the migrant population.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the Neuropsychomotor Development (NPMD) of newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the perinatal period using the Bayley III scale at 6 months of age. Methods: Childcare appointments were scheduled for the included newborns in the study. During the 6-month consultation, the Screening Test for Bayley III Scale and, based on it, children were classified as “low risk”, “moderate risk” or “high risk” in the domains: of cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor, and gross motor. Those classified as “moderate risk”; or “high risk” received guidance about NPMD stimuli and were instructed to maintain follow-up. Results: Only 13 (37.1 %) of the newborns were classified as low risk in receptive language and 18 (51.4 %) in gross motor skills, with the domains most affected. Prematurity was a risk for cognitive incompetence (moderate risk/high-risk classification) (coefficient: 1.89, Odds Ratio = 6.7, 95 % CI 1.3‒35, p = 0.02). Lower birth weight that 2.500g had a similar effect on cognitive incompetence (coefficient: 1.9, Odds Ratio = 6.2, 95 % CI 1.2‒32.2, p = 0.02). Exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge (n = 8) was protective for incompetence (high risk/moderate risk) in the language domain (coefficient -2.14, OR = 0.12, 95 % CI 0.02‒0.71, p = 0.02). Conclusions: The children included in the study must be monitored and their development monitored in order to clarify whether there is a relationship between the delay in NPMD and perinatal exposure to COVID-19, as delays were observed in these preliminary results.

N2  - Background We describe clients in Mexico City’s public abortion programme, Interrupción Legal de Embarazo (ILE), during the COVID-19 pandemic and test whether the pandemic exacerbated inequities in access. Methods We conducted a cohort study of all abortions in the ILE programme from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2022. We compared patients from within and outside the Mexico City Metropolitan area (ZMVM) by pandemic stage (pre-, acute-, mid- and late-COVID periods) and assessed changes in client characteristics (adolescent age, education, weeks’ gestation) by place of residence (ZMVM vs outside the ZMVM) using linear probability models clustered on state. Results We included 45031 abortions. The proportion of abortions to women who travelled from outside the ZMVM decreased from 6.5% pre-COVID to 4.4%–4.8% in in the acute, mid- and late-COVID periods. The adjusted probability of being an adolescent who travelled from outside the ZMVM dropped between pre-COVID (14.4%, 95% CI 12.7% to 16.1%) and mid-COVID (9.3%, 95% CI 7.9% to 10.7%). The proportion of abortions to women with a high school education stayed fairly flat among those travelling, while it rose among those residing in the ZMVM. The adjusted probability of presenting at 11 gestational weeks or greater was higher among women residing in the ZMVM in the pre-pandemic period; this flipped during all pandemic stages, with a higher probability of presenting at 11 weeks or greater among those who travelled from outside the ZMVM. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing disparities in who can access ILE services. To reduce inequities in access to essential health services, public sector abortion services should be made available in all Mexican states.

N2  - In Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries, women are particularly affected by food insecurity (FI). This gender gap can be amplified at certain key periods in life, particularly during pregnancy, with negative consequences on maternal and infant health. In the current geopolitical and health context, it is essential to take stock of the prevalence of FI among pregnant women in this region and the associated economic and psychosocial determinants. From 168 publications identified on Pubmed and Scopus, this systematic review selected 13 publications in 7 LAC countries. Although the published data only described the situation before the COVID-19 pandemic (2009–2019), the prevalence of FI in this population was already worrying, ranging from 28.2% to 64.9%. Only 4 of 13 studies investigated socioeconomic and psychosocial determinants among mothers in this region. Thus, the factors most frequently reported concerned mothers’ demographic characteristics (advanced age and ethnic minority), household socioeconomic characteristics (low income, poorest wealth quartile, precarious housing, and welfare recipients), the absence of a stable partner, and a low education level. High prevalences of FI have also been associated with mental distress during pregnancy. In conclusion, few recent studies (notably none since the COVID-19 pandemic) have been published in this region on the issue of FI among women during pregnancy. Yet, this knowledge is essential to the development of a logical framework for the implementation and evaluation of public health programs aimed at women and children. By reducing the FI of mothers in the LAC region, we will contribute to reducing the social inequalities in health that often manifest themselves very early in life. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42024513321 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=513321).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the fear, anxiety, and knowledge level in women who underwent gynecological surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 188 women who underwent a gynecologic surgical operation in Muğla, Turkey. Data were collected by using demographics and obstetric detail form, questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward COVID-19, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-I (STAI-I). RESULTS: Most of the women perceived their surgical process as very urgent. Women felt fear mostly for being infected with the virus, and they were afraid of transmitting COVID-19 to another one. The COVID-19 knowledge scores of women who had undergone cancer surgery were statistically significantly higher than others (p=0.017). The STAI-I scores of women increased as their COVID-19 knowledge scores increased (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that women were afraid of COVID-19 infection during gynecological operation and due to hospitalization, sociodemographic characteristics affected the knowledge levels about COVID-19 infection, and the anxiety levels of the women. Planning appropriate interventions to decrease the fear and anxiety of women who undergo gynecological surgery during the pandemic is important to ensure that women adhere to their treatment and follow-up in the postoperative period.

N2  - Suicide is one of the leading death causes worldwide, mainly among young adults, and Colombia has experienced an increase during the XXI century. The suicide impact has diverged between age groups and locations in Colombia, where young adults have taken higher incidences than the other age groups. The COVID-19 lockdown induced changes in mental health, affecting the previous suicide trends in the country. We conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of suicide attempts in Colombia per age group, adopting Bayesian models that represent 85,526 individual records in 1,121 municipalities from 2018 to 2020 using R-INLA. We found that Colombia exhibited an increase in suicide-attempt incidence from 2018 to 2019, and suddenly, the incidence fell in the first semester of 2020. The fixed effect of the models evidenced the highest risk in overall municipalities per trimester in the age group between 15-19 years old. The spatial random effect per model evidenced municipalities with the highest risk in the age groups between 10 to 59 years, mainly in the states in the Andean region of Colombia, and other states such as Putumayo, Vaupés, Arauca, Córdoba, Amazonas, and Meta. The temporal random effect evidenced a decay in suicide trends from the fourth trimester of 2019 to 2020, except in the age group > 59 years old. Geographically, our study pinpointed specific regions in Colombia, particularly in the central, southwest, and southeast areas, where the incidence of suicide attempts exceeded 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The nuanced breakdown of incidence across different age groups further underscores the importance of tailoring preventive strategies based on age-specific and regional risk factors.

N2  - Background Maternity outcomes for women from certain ethnic groups are notably poor, partly owing to their not receiving treatment from services. Aims To explore barriers to access among Black and south Asian women with perinatal mental health problems who did not access perinatal mental health services and suggestions for improvements, and to map findings on to the perinatal care pathway. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2020 and 2021 in the UK. Data were analysed using the framework method. Results Twenty-three women were interviewed, and various barriers were identified, including limited awareness of services, fear of child removal, stigma and unresponsiveness of perinatal mental health services. Whereas most barriers were related to access, fear of child removal, remote appointments and mask-wearing during COVID-19 affected the whole pathway. Recommendations include service promotion, screening and enhanced cultural understanding. Conclusions Women in this study, an underrepresented population in published literature, face societal, cultural, organisational and individual barriers that affect different aspects of the perinatal pathway.

The participants of the study were 58 pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (group A) and 40 women with a physiological course of pregnancy (group B), as well as their newborns. In addition to the analysis of standard examinations results, perinatal consequences for the mother and the fetus/newborn, the association between the saturation level (S O2) in the pregnant woman, the short-term heart rate variability (STV) according to cardiotocography data of the fetus and the assessment of the newborn according to the Apgar scale was studied. Results. The S O2 level was 95% or more in 87.9% of infected pregnant women, in 12.06% it was 90–94% (critical for pregnant women). 10.3% of pregnant women needed intensive therapy and respiratory support, 69% of women had infammatory changes in the chest organs (pneumonia, etc.). Cardiotocography showed a signifcant diference in the type of basal heart rate between the groups (χ2 = 14.9055, p = 0,00058) and STV (7.78 ± 2.56 vs 8.39 ± 2.03 ms) in groups A and B, respectively (U = 687, p = 0.00022). The Apgar scale index in groups A and B was 6.48 ± 2.39 and 8.05 ± 0.54 points, respectively (χ2 = 21.933, df = 4). 20% of newborns in group B had 7 points in the frst minute, 80% had 8 points or more. 51.85% of newborns in group A had scored 7 points or less (F = 0.00246, p < 0.05, odds ratio 4.308, 95% CI 1.681 – 11.037). 10.34% of newborns required intensive care, 5.17% – administration of surfactant, 1.72% – artifcial lung ventilation. Regression analysis showed that the Apgar scale indicator at the frst minute of life in newborns in group A depends on the S O2 level of the pregnant woman (Y = 0.89X1 – 79.19), as well as on the STV (Y = 0.89X1 + 0.028X2 – 79.53), where Y is the score on the Apgar scale, X1 is the S O2 in a pregnant woman, X2 is the STV. Conclusions. Assessment of the hypoxemia degree in pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and the cardiotocographic assessment of the fetus state require special attention: there is a direct association between these indicators and the assessment of the newborn according to the Apgar scale, which allows predicting the course of the period of early neonatal adaptation. It is recommended that these newborns be classifed as a risk group with a violation of the adaptation period and possible long-term consequences.

N2  - Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on global mental health. Health care students, both as young people and regarding their student condition, were a more at-risk population. During the first and the third waves, two national surveys already found high levels of psychological distress (21 to 83% of severe psychological distress). This nationwide study focused on health care student changes in substance or treatment use during the pandemic. Methods: We did an online national cross-sectional study addressing all health care students in France from April 4 to May 11, 2021. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and work conditions questions, Kessler 6 scale, and simple questions about psychotropic treatments or substance use. Results: We obtained 16,937 answers, including 54% nurses and 16% medical students. Increased psychoactive substance use (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis) was associated with males, older students, those having financial difficulties and using more psychotropic treatments. Nursing students were more at risk than others. Increased psychotropic treatment use (anxiolytics, hypnotics) was associated with being a woman, older, having financial difficulties, having high psychological distress, and using more psychoactive substances. Medical, pharmacy, dental and midwife students were more at risk than others. The response rate was low (5,6%), and nursing students represented more than half of the respondents. Conclusions: Compared to our first national survey, substance use (21% versus 13%) and psychotropic treatment use (18% versus 7.3%) increased hugely. These results highlight the need to identify the specific causes of substance use by health care students to better support them. As future health professionals, this is a major public health issue.

N2  - Objective Rising maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States is a complex problem and is often tied to the postpartum period. Postpartum visits are poorly attended leading to gaps in contraception, mental health care, and care for chronic conditions. mHealth, health care supported by mobile technologies, has been shown to improve antenatal care adherence. Our study aims to determine whether an mHealth intervention of interactive, educational text messages can improve care for women postpartum. Study Design We conducted a randomized control trial of 191 women receiving OB/GYN care in our clinic from November 2019 to April 2020. Patients were randomized postpartum to receive either routine care or routine care with mHealth text messages and appointment reminders specific to delivery type. The primary endpoint was attendance at the 6-week postpartum visit with secondary endpoints of breastfeeding, contraception use, emergency visits, and postpartum depression scores (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). A subgroup analysis was additionally conducted to assess the impact of some visits shifting to telehealth due to the timing of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Results Patient demographics were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in postpartum appointment attendance between text messages (n = 57, 59%) and control groups (n = 62, 66%; p = 0.31). In total, 117 patients were scheduled for in-person postpartum visits, and 74 for telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no significant difference in attendance rate between groups for either visit modality. Conclusion Automated text messages alone did not increase our primary outcome of adherence to postpartum care, even when visits were conducted by telehealth. While mHealth has proven successful in other care areas, such as antepartum follow-up, further research is needed to determine whether it is an effective method to improve adherence to postpartum care, or whether other strategies must be developed, including augmentation with human navigators.

N2  - Objective. To examine maternal mortality in Panama, analyzing its direct obstetric deaths, indirect obstetric deaths, and contributory conditions. Methods. This cohort study used publicly available data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census to present a 25-year retrospective analysis of maternal deaths in the Republic of Panama from 1998 to 2022. Public data were sourced from the National Institute of Statistics and Census website of Panama. Relevant codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD) were used. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. Trendline reliability with R2 was performed to analyze the data. Results. A total of 1 026 maternal deaths occurred in Panama from 1998 through 2022, of which 61.2% were attributed to direct obstetric causes; 23.9%, indirect obstetric causes; 13.6%, contributory conditions; and 1.4% were unknown or undetermined. The average MMR was 60.1. The trendline reliability resulted in R2 = 0.1 (y = –0.5147x + 1094.7), which is not statistically significant but meets the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The specific primary causes of direct obstetric deaths were: 12.9% due to postpartum hemorrhage (ICD O72); 9.2%, eclampsia (ICD O15); 6.7%, puerperal sepsis (ICD O85); and 6.3%, pre-eclampsia (ICD O14). For indirect obstetric deaths, the primary causes were: 14.9% due to other maternal diseases classifiable elsewhere but complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (ICD O99); and 7.3%, maternal infectious and parasitic diseases classifiable elsewhere but complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (ICD O98). Conclusions. The findings of this study confirmed that there were substantially more direct obstetric causes (61.2%) than indirect obstetric causes (23.9%), contributory causes (13.6%), or unknown/undetermined causes (1.4%) of maternal mortality, despite being highly preventable. Although Panama is right on track to fulfill the target of 70 MMR by 2030, these results highlight the lack of health care access due to the absence of obstetrician-gynecologists per 100 000 population in indigenous comarcas, where 30.8% of the maternal mortalities occur. Furthermore, the health system in Panama is not immune to pandemics and crises. From 1998 to 2022, there were 5 years when the MMR in Panama exceeded 70: 2001, 2002, 2006, 2011, and 2020. These findings also underscore the dichotomy between statistics and health policy. While the trendline reliability was insignificant (R2 = 0.1), the MMR satisfies requirements for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Future studies should consider factors related to indirect obstetrics and contributory causes of deaths, health care access, COVID-19, cesarean section and natural birth, age, economic income, prenatal and postpartum care, as well as the quality of private and public health facilities in the Americas.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Access to appropriate postpartum care is essential for improving maternal health outcomes and promoting maternal health equity. OBJECTIVE To analyze the impact of the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) home visiting program on use of routine and emergency postpartum care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that enrolled eligible participants between 2016 and 2020 to receive NFP or usual care from a South Carolina Medicaid program. Participants were nulliparous pregnant individuals at less than 28 weeks’ gestation at enrollment who were enrolled in Medicaid during pregnancy or delivery. Analysis was performed February 2, 2023, to July 16, 2024. INTERVENTION Participants were enrolled in a 2:1 ratio to receive NFP, an established model of nurse home visiting, or usual care. NFP visits are conducted prenatally and for up to 2 years post partum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This study assessed one of the trial’s preregistered secondary outcomes: attendance at a routine postpartum health care visit before 12 weeks post partum. Other exploratory outcomes included outpatient care use, hospitalization, and emergent, nonemergent, and any use of emergency department (ED) health services at 12 weeks and 1 year post partum. Subgroup analyses examined individuals who underwent cesarean delivery, had chronic disease, experienced pregnancy complications, reported non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity, were socially vulnerable, or were unaffected by COVID-19. RESULTS Among 5670 participants enrolled, 4877 were analyzed (median [IQR] age, 21 [19-25] years), including 3261 who received NFP and 1616 who received usual care. By race and ethnicity, the sample included 259 Hispanic individuals (5.7%); 56 non-Hispanic Asian, Indigenous, or Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander individuals (1.2%); 2535 non-Hispanic Black individuals (55.4%); 1587 non-Hispanic White individuals (34.7%); and 141 individuals (3.1%) with more than 1 race reported (and non-Hispanic ethnicity). There was no significant difference in attendance of routine postpartum visit at 12 weeks between NFP and usual care groups (63.8% vs 64.2%; adjusted difference [AD] −0.3 [95% CI, −3.2 to 2.5] percentage points). In exploratory analyses, the NFP group was less likely to have a visit to the ED without admission (AD, −2.5 [95% CI, −4.8 to −0.1] percentage points) in the first 12 weeks post partum. Other outcomes, including hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and emergent and nonemergent ED visits, were not different between intervention and control groups. There were also no statistically significant differences within subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of nulliparous pregnant individuals with low income, nurse home visiting did not increase use of routine postpartum care in the immediate or extended postpartum periods, even among those with greater health challenges. Nurse home visiting was associated with reduced ED use. More research is needed on how to improve continuity of perinatal care for low-income populations.

N2  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rhode Island implemented a telehealth waiver allowing telehealth parity. This study investigated (1) if telehealth allowed for patients who seek mental health services to maintain visit frequency and (2) if subpopulations were less likely to utilize telehealth. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the change in total number of visits, in-person visits from pre-waiver to post-waiver, and a multivariate linear regression to identify relationships between demographics and telehealth utilization. Participants were able to maintain the frequency of visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Race/ethnicity, age, gender, employment status, and housing status were all statistically significant predictors of telehealth utilization. Telehealth aids in the continuing of care when in-person visits are not a viable option. Access to telehealth is crucial during public health emergencies and aids in maintaining visit frequency. Further research should be done to evaluate subgroups who are less likely to utilize telehealth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in maternity service delivery in England, including: antenatal appointments being cancelled or held by phone; women having to attend antenatal scans alone; partners not being allowed to accompany women during labor; visitor restrictions on postnatal wards; and limited postnatal support. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 46 women aged 18-45 who had low-risk pregnancies and gave birth to their babies using NHS services in England between 1st March 2020 and 1st March 2021. RESULTS: Our thematic analysis of interview data generated key themes: profound negative impacts of birth partners not being allowed to accompany women (including on emotional wellbeing, birth preferences and care-seeking choices); deep frustration about policy variation between trusts and inconsistent implementation of guidance; women being more concerned about the risk of giving birth alone than of COVID-19 infection; and women turning towards private care or delaying seeking NHS care so that they could have the birth experience they desired. The latter two results are, to the best of our knowledge, unique to this paper. CONCLUSION: Our participants reported significant negative affects to their emotional and physical wellbeing because of maternity service restrictions. Going forward, efforts are required by policymakers and health service providers to re-establish trust in NHS maternity care and ensure capacity to provide for potential shifts in birthplace preferences. Health systems strengthening efforts should prioritise protecting the rights of women to access high quality, person-centred care in the event of future health emergencies that strain NHS capacity.

N2  - AIM: We explored midwives' experiences and challenges in providing maternity care during the period of the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in Dodoma. DESIGN: Phenomenological study design was used to explore midwives' experiences and challenges in providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted interviews with a total of 23 midwives, using semi-structured interviews and an audio recorder. Five focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted. To analyse the data, we used interpretive phenomenological thematic data analysis with NVivo software. To analyse templates, we followed a step-by-step process, starting with familiarizing ourselves with the data, followed by preliminary coding, organizing themes, developing an initial coding template, using the initial template, refining the template and finally applying it to the entire dataset. RESULTS: It was found that three themes and eight subthemes merged in the current study. The main themes were ① mental health distress, ② work environment challenges and ③ isolation of midwives by different groups. PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Reducing risk and protecting midwives from infectious diseases will improve the workforce, reduce the number of hospital stays, reduce the cost of hospital services, improve birth outcomes and indirectly improve family, community and national economies. CONCLUSION: Due to the system's failure to provide psychological support, protective environment and isolation rooms for confirmed or suspected cases put midwives at a higher risk of contracting the virus and had to work in a stressful environment. In addition to having the right tools, midwives must also receive emotional and psychological support in order to be at their best. The system must ensure that midwives are ready for uncertain times, such as pandemic infectious disease outbreaks, by providing protective work place environment such as personal protective equipment, psychological support and isolation room for confirmed COVID-19 cases.

N2  - The law ought to ensure that reproductive health services are accessible to all persons - married or unmarried - without subjecting them to heightened scrutiny or procedural requirements. However, the intersection of various laws and their impact on the willingness of medical professionals to offer abortion and reproductive health services to adolescents makes timely, safe, and affordable abortions difficult for adolescents to obtain. This challenge is exacerbated by a lack of public healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas, and the overall restricted access to healthcare services during the Covid-19 pandemic. We delve into how legal uncertainties and gaps in multiple legislations pose obstacles for adolescents seeking abortion services, particularly in consensual sexual relationships. We specifically examine the unintended barriers stemming from the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), which categorises consensual sexual relationships among adolescents as sexual offences without recognising their evolving sexual autonomy. Notably, POCSO includes a mandatory reporting provision, compelling the reporting of all sexual offences involving a "child" to law enforcement. This complexity is further compounded by the requirement for third-party authorisation for abortion by medical boards. The Indian courts, in rendering inconsistent, moralistic, and biased judgments on adolescent access to abortion services during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed to the complexities.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of behavioral problems and the internal consistency of the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P) in Amazonian preschool children during the covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data from the Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition in Acre (MINA-Brazil) study, a population-based birth cohort in the Western Brazilian Amazon, were used. The SDQ-P was applied in 2021 at the five-year follow-up visit to parents or caregivers of 695 children (49.4% of which were girls). This instrument is a short behavioral screening questionnaire composed of 25 items reorganized into five subscales: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior. Cases of behavioral problems were defined according to the original SDQ cut-offs based on United Kingdom norms. Moreover, cut off points were estimated based on the SDQ-P percentile results of our study sample. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient and McDonald's omega for each scale. RESULTS: According to the cut-offs based on our studied population distribution, 10% of all children had high or very high total difficulty scores, whereas it was almost twice when the original SDQ cut-offs based on United Kingdom norms, were applied (18%). Differences were also observed in the other scales. Compared to girls, boys showed higher means of externalizing problem and lower means of prosocial behavior. The five-factor model showed a moderate internal consistency of the items for all scales (0.60 ≤ α ≤ 0.40), except for total difficulty scores, which it considered substantial (α > 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the usefulness of SDQ in our study population and reinforce the need for strategies and policy development for mental health care in early life in the Amazon.

N2  - Introduction: In March 2020 many countries around the world, including Finland, implemented lockdown measures to mitigate the unprecedented impacts of the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) on public health. As a result, school and daycare settings closed indefinitely and working from home became the new normal for a big part of the workforce, which came with increased homeschooling and childcare responsibility for mothers. Methods: In this article we present the findings from maternal responses to open ended questions on psychosocial well-being, and experiences of combining work, family life and homeschooling during the COVID-19 national lockdown in Finland in March-May 2020. Working mothers' responses (n = 72) were analyzed through the lens of Karasek's job demand-control model, focusing on how the mothers experienced the demands of their life during the lockdown, and how they saw their possibilities to control the situation. Results: The findings indicated important variation in the level of experienced demand and control and associated compensatory factors during the COVID-19 lockdown across different subgroups of working mothers. Discussion: The findings have implications for understanding strain and plausible supports among working mothers during the COVID-19 lockdown as well as in the face of acute adversity including the next possible public health crisis.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on maternal and child services and adversely influenced pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review aims to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to and delivery of maternal and child healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: The review was reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A primary search of electronic databases was performed using a combination of search terms related to the following areas of interest: "impact' AND 'COVID-19' AND 'maternal and child health services' AND 'low- and middle-income countries. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyse and integrate the results. Results: Overall, 45 unique studies conducted across 28 low- and middle-income countries met the inclusion criteria for the review. The findings suggest the number of family planning visits, antenatal and postnatal care visits, consultations for sick children, paediatric emergency visits and child immunisation levels decreased compared to the pre-pandemic levels in the majority of included studies. An analytical framework including four main categories was developed based on the concepts that emerged from included studies: the anxiety of not knowing (1), overwhelmed healthcare systems (2), challenges perceived by healthcare professionals (3) and difficulties perceived by service users (4). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted family planning services, antenatal and postnatal care coverage, and emergency and routine child services. Generalised conclusions are tentative due to the heterogeneity and inconsistent quality of the included studies. Future research is recommended to define the pandemic's impact on women and children worldwide and prepare healthcare systems for future resurgences of COVID-19 and potential challenges beyond.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: to identify factors associated with adherence to the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. METHOD: cross-sectional and analytical study with 348 postpartum women in shared accommodation at the Municipal Maternities of Recife-PE. Data was collected through interviews during the months of June to September 2022. Pearson's Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact tests and the Poisson regression model were applied for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 17.2% of pregnant women adhered to the complete vaccination schedule, and adherence was associated with access to the internet/TV/radio (p-value = 0.011), routine prenatal vaccination (p-value = 0.019), safety of the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and partner support (p-value = 0.020). Postpartum women without access to the internet/TV/radio, and who feel confident about the effectiveness of the vaccine, had higher prevalence rates for adhering to COVID-19 vaccination, with PRs of 2.56 and 3.25, respectively. CONCLUSION: there was evidence of low adherence to the vaccination schedule against COVID-19 during the gestational period, considering the number of recommended doses and the interval between them. Therefore, professionals in their clinical practice must make pregnant women aware of the importance of immunization and compliance with the vaccination schedule. BACKGROUND: (1) Maternal vaccination plays a significant role in preventing and combating maternal morbidity. (2) Some factors may influence acceptance or hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. (3) Safety regarding the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy is a factor associated with adherence to COVID-19 vaccines. (4) Postpartum women without access to the internet/TV/radio have 2.56 times the risk of adhering to the COVID-19 vaccination schedule. (5) Health education helps to increase the level of knowledge and acceptance of the vaccine by pregnant women.

N2  - Background: Public health emergencies impose unique challenges on pregnant women, affecting their physiological, psychological, and social wellbeing. This study, focusing on the context of the corona virus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China, aims to comprehensively explore the experiences of pregnant women amidst diverse public health crises. Herein, we investigate the health education needs of pregnant Chinese women in regard to public health emergencies to provide a scientific foundation for the development of targeted health education strategies. Objective: The study described in this article aims to explore the health education needs of pregnant Chinese women in the context of public health emergencies specifying the types of emergencies of pandemics and to provide a scientific basis for targeted health education interventions. Methods: Thirteen pregnant women were purposively selected, and the rationale for this sample size lies in the qualitative nature of the study, seeking in-depth insights rather than generalizability. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, and the Colaizzi, which is a structured qualitative technique used to extract, interpret, and organize significant statements from participant descriptions into themes, providing a comprehensive understanding of their lived experiences. Results: The analysis yielded six prominent themes encompassing the following areas: I. Personal protection and vaccine safety; II. Knowledge of maternal health; III. Knowledge of fetal health; IV. Knowledge of childbirth; V. Knowledge of postpartum recovery; and VI. Knowledge sources of health education for pregnant women and their expectations of healthcare providers. Theme I was analyzed with two sub-themes (needs for personal protection knowledge, vaccine safety knowledge needs); Theme II was analyzed with three sub-themes (nutrition and diet, exercise and rest, sexual life); Theme III was analyzed with three sub-themes (medications and hazardous substances, pregnancy check-ups, and fetal movement monitoring); Theme IV was analyzed with three sub-themes (family accompaniment, analgesia in childbirth, and choice of mode of delivery); Theme V was analyzed with one sub-theme (knowledge of postnatal recovery); Theme VI was analyzed with one sub-theme (expectations of Healthcare providers). Sub-themes within each main theme were identified, offering a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted challenges faced by pregnant women during public health emergencies. The interrelation between sub-themes and main themes contributes to a holistic portrayal of their experiences. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for healthcare professionals to tailor health education for pregnant women during emergencies, highlighting the role of the Internet in improving information dissemination. It recommends actionable strategies for effective health communication, ensuring these women receive comprehensive support through digital platforms for better health outcomes during public health crises.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe temporal trends in the detection rates of gestational and congenital syphilis, by maternal age and health macro-region of the state of Paraná, Brazil, 2007-2021. METHODS: This was a time-series study using surveillance data; the trend analysis was performed by means of joinpoint regression, and average annual percent change (AAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated. RESULTS: An increase in statewide detection of gestational syphilis (AAPC = 21.7; 95%CI 17.7; 32.8) and congenital syphilis (AAPC = 14.8; 95%CI 13.0; 19.7) was found; an increase was also found in the health macro-regions, with the Northwest (gestational, AAPC = 26.1; 95%CI 23.4; 31.6) and North (congenital, AAPC = 23.8; 95%CI 18.8; 48.9) macro-regions standing out; statewide rising trends were observed for young women [gestational, AAPC = 26.2 (95%CI 22.4; 40.6); congenital, AAPC = 19.4 (95%CI 17.6; 21.8)] and adult women [gestational, AAPC = 21.3 (95%CI 16.9; 31.9); congenital, AAPC = 13.7 (95%CI 11.9; 19.3)]. CONCLUSION: Maternal and child syphilis detection rates increased in the state, regardless of maternal age and health macro-region. MAIN RESULTS: Increasing trends were found for the detection rates of gestational and congenital syphilis in Paraná state and its health macro-regions, including in the analysis stratified by maternal age group; however, there was a decline during the COVID-19 period. IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: There is a need for strategic and immediate action by the state health services, focusing on expanding access and linkage to care, in order to ensure maternal and child well-being and reverse the rising trends observed. PERSPECTIVES: Prevention and control actions towards the elimination of syphilis are needed to overcome these obstacles, directing efforts towards strengthening health education, early detection and appropriate treatment for pregnant women and their partners.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigates burnout and subjective well-being among the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) workforce, considering recent events such as the Dobbs decision, the maternal mortality crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous web-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 313 MCH professionals in the United States. Data were collected using validated measures, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) short scale. Sociodemographic characteristics and factors associated with burnout and subjective well-being were examined using univariate statistics and multivariable models. RESULTS: Analysis revealed moderate levels of burnout among MCH professionals, particularly in emotional exhaustion. However, subjective well-being levels were relatively high. After controlling for covariates, significant associations were found between subjective well-being and burnout dimensions, as well as sociodemographic factors such as sex and race. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings indicate that higher subjective well-being is significantly associated with lower burnout, emotional exhaustion, and higher personal accomplishment. Variations in burnout and well-being are also influenced by sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, race, and occupation. Tailored interventions addressing the specific needs of MCH professionals are essential for building a resilient workforce. Organizational reforms and legislative measures are crucial for fostering supportive workplace environments and ensuring access to care and services amidst workforce challenges.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major outbreak in the 21st century and has led to significant mental health hazards worldwide. To address this issue, a systematic review has been conducted to analyze existing literature on the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of the general population, as well as the associated risk factors. Methods: A comprehensive search was carried out on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, covering all available literature up until February 20, 2024. This search was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, ensuring a systematic approach. The selection of articles was based on predetermined eligibility criteria, ensuring the inclusion of appropriate and suitable research. In the final analysis, a total of 15 articles focusing on depression and anxiety, 11 articles on stress, and 7 articles on psychological problems were included. These articles specifically examined the outcome variables within the context of English language and specific areas. For the meta-analysis on maternal health services, 11 articles were included for family planning, 25 articles for postnatal care services, 16 articles for institutional delivery, and 14 articles for safe abortion services. These articles were carefully selected for the final pooled analysis. Result: According to a recent systematic review, anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological distress have been prevalent in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic, with rates of 40, 41, 23, and 41%, respectively. The review also identified various sociodemographic factors that have impacted the country's response to the pandemic, including female gender, age, marital status, incarceration, low income, and lack of social support. Furthermore, the review found that maternal health services have experienced significant reductions during the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in psychological distress, which in some cases, is severe enough to require clinical treatment. It is crucial to prioritize efforts to address the negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health as a global public health priority. Additionally, it is important to pay attention to maternal health services during COVID-19 mitigation programs.

N2  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected the provision of and demand for routine health services in the world. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary maternal and child health (MCH) services in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: The studies searched original studies reporting on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary MCH services. Four scientific databases (Pubmed, AJOL, CAIRN, CINAHL) and one gray literature database (Google Scholar) were used for this search. We also searched through the snowball citation approach and study reference lists. Results: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary MCH services has been mixed in sub-Saharan Africa. Attendance at some health centers declined for antenatal care, deliveries, immunization, and pneumonia cases. Other health centers did not experience a significant influence of the pandemic on some of these services. In fact, antenatal care increased in a number of health centers. MCH service indicators which declined during COVID-19 were linked on the demand side to regulatory measures against COVID-19, the perceived unavailability of resources for routine services, the perceived negative attitude of staff in these facilities, the perceived transmission risk in primary health care facilities and the perceived anticipated stigma. On the supply side, factors included the lack of equipment in primary facilities, the lack of guidelines for providing care in the pandemic context, the regulatory measures against COVID-19 taken in these facilities, and the lack of motivation of providers working in these facilities. Conclusion: This study recommends prioritizing the improvement of infection prevention measures in primary health care facilities for resilience of MCH indicators to epidemic crises. Improvement efforts should be tailored to the disparities in preventive measures between health centers. The identification of best practices from more resilient health centers could better guide these efforts.

N2  - Introduction: Infectious diseases can spread rapidly in the globalized world, and the complex intersection of individual, social, economic, and cultural factors make it difficult to identify vulnerabilities in the face of pandemics. Methods: Therefore, this study aimed to identify vulnerability factors to infection and worse outcomes associated with COVID-19. This is a scoping review study of six databases that selected publications between 2019 and 2023, focusing on individual, social, and programmatic dimensions of vulnerability. The results were recorded in a spreadsheet and analyzed, considering the interrelationships among these dimensions. Results: A total of 45 articles were included in the review. Content analysis was conducted using the theoretical framework of health vulnerability, which divides vulnerability into individual, social, and programmatic dimensions. Race/ethnicity, homelessness, incarceration, socioeconomic level, food insecurity, and remote areas were classified as social dimensions. On the other hand, cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, advanced age, obesity, mental disorders, diabetes, kidney disease, and pregnancy were classified as individual dimensions. None of the publications found explicitly mentioned programmatic vulnerabilities. Discussion: The research found that social vulnerabilities reinforce individual vulnerabilities, creating a vicious cycle. In addition, programmatic vulnerabilities reinforce this relationship. This study emphasizes that public policies should address these different dimensions of vulnerability. It suggests that this information should be incorporated into health surveillance and future decision-making to face new pandemics.

N2  - REVIEW QUESTION: What is the impact of Covid-19 upon the mental health and well-being of women during pregnancy and during the perinatal period? INCLUSION CRITERIA: empirical primary research; maternal mental health and wellbeing; perinatal period; Covid-19; English or Thai language; studies from December 2019-September 2021, updated March 2024. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: secondary research, commentary, grey literature. Databases searched: CINAHL, Cochrane, JBI, Medline, PsycINFO, Clinical Key and Web of Science. Studies were assessed for bias using tools aligned with study design. A convergent integrated approach was taken whereby quantitative data was combined with qualitative data, synthesised simultaneously using Braun and Clarke Six Steps to Thematical Analysis and presented as narrative. Forty-two studies were included. Overall level of methodological quality of studies was 14 rated good, 28 fair. Overarching themes: "Impact" and "Emotional Impact." Themes: demographic impact; mental health and socio-economic factors; obstetric factors; pre-morbidity; maternity service delivery; relationships; fear and worry, grief and loss. Commonality suggested some evidence for increased risk and prevalence for perinatal mental illness to pre-pandemic levels. RISK FACTORS: lack/perceived lack of social support; high-risk pregnancy, complex obstetric history; prior mental illness; maternity service delivery, quality and safety; fear and worry. Results confer perinatal mental illness prominent during the pandemic though many did not suggest prevalence higher than pre-pandemic levels, or directly associated. Several factors compound risk. A small number of protective factors are identified. The dynamic processes of risk and protection need to be understood within the specific context in which they operate. The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article. The study was not registered.

N2  - Background: The development and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines have been a breakthrough in controlling the pandemic. However, the vaccination coverage in most low-income countries remains very low due to critical vaccine shortage and profound hesitancy. In this scoping review, we aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine uptake, acceptance, and hesitancy in Ethiopia and Tanzania. Methods: The search was made in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. Only original research articles focusing on vaccine acceptance and hesitancy were included. The studies selected for a full read were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Findings: A total of 76 articles were included in the study, with 74 of them coming from Ethiopia. The study found an increasing trend in vaccine uptake over time. However, there was also an increase in hesitancy and a decline in willingness to receive the vaccine. The willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Ethiopia ranged from 18.5 to 88%. The main reasons for "vaccine hesitancy" included fear of side effects, concerns about long-term safety, doubts about vaccine effectiveness, lack of information, vaccine fast-tracking, and religious beliefs. The study also found that younger individuals, females, and pregnant women were less willing to receive the vaccine. The adverse events reported among vaccinated individuals were mostly mild. Most of the studies operationalised vaccine acceptance-hesitancy as dichotomous variables. However, the historical, political, and socio-cultural context in which vaccine acceptance and hesitancy occur was not given any attention. While there is a good amount of data from Ethiopia describing patterns of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among different populations over time, there is limited information from Tanzania due to the late arrival of the vaccine and limited published articles. Conclusion: We have observed a paradox involving two seemingly conflicting trends: an increase in vaccination rates/coverage and "anti-vax." Most studies have simplified vaccine acceptance-hesitancy as an "either-or" incident, without considering its dynamic nature and occurrence within a broader political, social, and cultural context. Therefore, it is crucial to explore approaches that can enhance our understanding of the vaccine acceptance-hesitancy phenomenon, in order to improve vaccine trust and uptake.

N2  - Introduction Armed conflict worldwide and across history has harmed the health of populations directly and indirectly, including generations beyond those immediately exposed to violence. The 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited by an ethnically Armenian population, provides an example of how conflict harmed health during COVID-19. We hypothesised that crises exposure would correspond to decreased healthcare utilisation rates and worse health outcomes for the maternal and infant population in Armenia, compounded during the pandemic. Methods Following a mixed-methods approach, we used ecological data from 1980 to 2020 to evaluate health trends in conflict, measured as battle-related deaths (BRDs), COVID-19 cases, and maternal and infant health indicators during periods of conflict and peace in Armenia. We also interviewed 10 key informants about unmet needs, maternal health-seeking behaviours and priorities during the war, collecting recommendations to mitigate the effects of future crisis on maternal and infant health. We followed a deductive coding approach to analyse transcripts and harvest themes. Results BRDs totalled more in the 2020 war compared with the previous Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts. Periods of active conflict between 1988–2020 were associated with increased rates of sick newborn mortality, neonatal mortality and pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Weekly average COVID-19 cases increased sevenfold during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Key informants expressed concerns about the effects of stress and grief on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes and recommended investing in healthcare system reform. Participants also stressed the synergistic effects of the war and COVID-19, noting healthcare capacity concerns and the importance of a strong primary care system. Conclusions Maternal and infant health measures showed adverse trends during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, potentially amplified by the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate effects of future crises on population health in Armenia, informants recommended investments in healthcare system reform focused on primary care and health promotion.

N2  - The prevalence of depression and anxiety in pregnant women is increasing and this is more important in migrants who are in the vulnerable group. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Syrian immigrant pregnant women admitted to a Migrant Health Center and the associated factors. The study is a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire prepared using sociodemographic characteristics and the Beck depression and anxiety inventories in Arabic was applied to the participants. The study was conducted with immigrant pregnant women who applied to the Migrant Health Center between July 8, 2022, and December 31, 2022. The study was conducted through health workers who speak Arabic and had received training on the subject beforehand. The mean age of the research group was 26.67 ± 5.98 years. Of the participants, 73.0 percent (%) had primary education or less, 95.0% had low income, 87.2% had 3 or less children and 98.5% described their health status as good or very good. The mean Beck anxiety inventory score of the participants was found to be 4.65 ± 3.17. The mean Beck depression inventory score was found to be 4.48 ± 2.53. Smoking and first pregnancy status were found to be associated with anxiety, whereas smoking and history of delivery beyond 42 weeks were found to be associated with depression (P .05). Anxiety and depression levels of immigrant pregnant women were found to be very low. Minimal anxiety was found in 99.3% of the immigrant pregnant women and 97.1% had no symptoms of depression. It is thought that effective psychosocial support activities for immigrant pregnant women should be carried out in a way to cover the entire target group.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of people globally, including pregnant women. We aimed to explore the influence of a psychological care intervention based on behavioral change theory on the prenatal mental state and mode of delivery in pregnant women from June 2020 to June 2022 during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the records of pregnant women who delivered in our hospital from June 2020 to June 2022. They were assigned to an observation and a control group according to the care that they received. The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was used to evaluate their negative emotions. The duration of each labor stage and the mode of delivery (cesarean section, spontaneous vaginal delivery, or assisted vaginal delivery) were recorded. A total of 216 women were included in the analysis. Before care, there were no significant differences in the SCL-90 scores between the 2 groups. After delivery, the SCL-90 scores in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The vaginal delivery rate in the observation group was 92.59%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (70.39%). The duration of the first stage of labor and the total duration of labor in the observation group were 447.95 ± 53.45 minutes and 498.15 ± 35.14 minutes, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the control group. The implementation of psychological care based on behavioral change theory in pregnant women during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic significantly improved their prenatal psychological state, promoted vaginal delivery, and help shorten the labor process, and reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This intervention is thus worth promoting.

N2  - Objective This study aims to describe the lived experiences of couples with a history of recurrent miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies and their perception of clinic support and cytogenetic investigations. Design A qualitative interview study with a phenomenological approach. Semistructured interviews were conducted using video conferencing software. Two researchers coded the transcripts and developed themes. Setting A National Health Service (NHS) hospital in central England between May 2021 and July 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants Patients attending a specialist recurrent miscarriage clinic and their partners. This clinic accepts referrals from all over the UK for couples who have suffered two or more miscarriages. Results Seventeen participants were interviewed: 14 women and 3 male partners. Six main themes were identified from the data. Three related to the women’s lived experience of recurrent miscarriage (emotions in pregnancy, confidence in their bodies, expectations and coping strategies) and three related to the clinical support offered by the NHS service (impact of early pregnancy scanning, effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and cytogenetic investigations). Conclusions Pregnancy following recurrent miscarriage is extremely difficult. Recurrent miscarriage specialist services can provide couples with support and access to early pregnancy scanning, which can make the first trimester of pregnancy manageable. Partners should not be excluded from the clinic as it can result in a feeling of disconnect. Cytogenetic testing of pregnancy tissue can offer couples with recurrent miscarriage closure after pregnancy loss and is a desired investigation.

N2  - Malaria is resurging in many African and South American countries, exacerbated by COVID-19-related health service disruption. In 2021, there were an estimated 247 million malaria cases and 619 000 deaths in 84 endemic countries. Plasmodium falciparum strains partly resistant to artemisinins are entrenched in the Greater Mekong region and have emerged in Africa, while Anopheles mosquito vectors continue to evolve physiological and behavioural resistance to insecticides. Elimination of Plasmodium vivax malaria is hindered by impractical and potentially toxic antirelapse regimens. Parasitological diagnosis and treatment with oral or parenteral artemisinin-based therapy is the mainstay of patient management. Timely blood transfusion, renal replacement therapy, and restrictive fluid therapy can improve survival in severe malaria. Rigorous use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy and infancy and seasonal chemoprevention, potentially combined with pre-erythrocytic vaccines endorsed by WHO in 2021 and 2023, can substantially reduce malaria morbidity. Improved surveillance, better access to effective treatment, more labour-efficient vector control, continued drug development, targeted mass drug administration, and sustained political commitment are required to achieve targets for malaria reduction by the end of this decade.

N2  - In January 2023, almost two years after the COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for the general Ivorian population, the Government of Côte d'Ivoire authorized the Pfizer vaccine for pregnant women. Qualitative research with 214 adults (including pregnant women) in three Ivorian cities in November 2022 revealed that most participants knew that the COVID-19 vaccine had not been recommended for pregnant women. Some participants felt that the policy change alone would be enough to motivate pregnant women to get vaccinated, but others felt that it would be difficult to convince pregnant women that the vaccine is safe for them and their babies. Pregnant women who participated in the study expressed a preference for waiting until after giving birth to get vaccinated against COVID-19, to be safe. They viewed the COVID-19 vaccine as risky during pregnancy but seemed unaware of the heightened risks that COVID-19 illness poses to pregnant women and babies. Pregnant participants stated that if they believed that the COVID-19 vaccine was good for the baby they would put aside their fears and get vaccinated. Reframing the conversation around the dangers of COVID-19 for pregnant women and their babies and positioning the COVID-19 vaccine as safe during pregnancy and protective, both during pregnancy and afterwards, could encourage uptake among this important segment of the population. Potential strategies to reinforce perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine safety for pregnant women include frequent and consistent messaging through both interpersonal and mass media channels; leveraging prenatal consultations and the relationship between health workers and pregnant women for both counseling and vaccination; and engaging influential others to support pregnant women in the decision to accept vaccination against COVID-19. Positive testimonials may help combat rumors that the vaccine negatively affects fertility and reproductive health, which could help to foster positive attitudes towards the vaccine before a woman even becomes pregnant and encourage broad vaccination among women of reproductive age.

N2  - Objectives During the COVID-19 pandemic, most essential services experienced some level of disruption. Disruption in LMICs was more severe than in HICs. Early reports suggested that services for maternal and newborn health were disproportionately affected, raising concerns about health equity. Most disruption indicators measure demand-side disruption, or they conflate demand-side and supply-side disruption. There is currently no published guidance on measuring supply-side disruption. The primary objective of this review was to identify methods and approaches used to measure supply-side service disruptions to maternal and newborn health services in the context of COVID-19. Design We carried out a systematic review and have created a typology of measurement methods and approaches using narrative synthesis. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health in January 2023. We also searched the grey literature. Eligibility criteria We included empirical studies describing the measurement of supply-side service disruption of maternal and newborn health services in LMICs in the context of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis We extracted the aim, method(s), setting, and study outcome(s) from included studies. We synthesised findings by type of measure (ie, provision or quality of services) and methodological approach (ie, qualitative or quantitative). Results We identified 28 studies describing 5 approaches to measuring supply-side disruption: (1) cross-sectional surveys of the nature and experience of supply-side disruption, (2) surveys to measure temporal changes in service provision or quality, (3) surveys to create composite disruption scores, (4) surveys of service users to measure receipt of services, and (5) clinical observation of the provision and quality of services. Conclusion Our review identified methods and approaches for measuring supply-side service disruption of maternal and newborn health services. These indicators provide important information about the causes and extent of supply-side disruption and provide a useful starting point for developing specific guidance on the measurement of service disruption in LMICs.

N2  - Objectives To investigate the prevalence of mental disorders and the higher rates of absenteeism from work among healthcare workers employed in Slovenia by analysing the prevalence of sick leave and medication prescriptions for treatment of mental health and behavioural disorders from 2015 to 2020. Design Retrospective analysis of nationwide data on absenteeism and prescription of medications for treatment of mental health and behavioural disorders (anxiolytics, antipsychotics, antidepressants). Setting National databases of the National Institute of Public Health in Slovenia. Participants All employed healthcare workers (35 008 in December 2020): dentists, midwives, nurses, nursing assistants, pharmacists and physicians in Slovenia from 2015 to 2020. Results The most time spent on sick leave by male healthcare workers aged >50 was for € neoplasms' (71.50 days on average), followed by € mental health and behavioural disorders' (62.08 days on average). Female healthcare workers under 40 years old spent the most time on sick leave for € pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period (puerperium)', causing an average of 58.38 days of sick leave. From 2015 to 2020, the highest increase in prescribed medications for treatment of mental health and behavioural disorders was among nursing assistants (an increase of 38.42%), pharmacists (an increase of 29.36%) and nurses (an increase of 26.61%); since the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase of 12.36% was found among dentists, an increase of 11.51% among pharmacists and an increase of 11.36% among nurses. Conclusion The prescription of medications for treatment of mental health and behavioural disorders was on the rise from 2015 to 2020. The importance of employee health to individuals and society necessitates the systematisation of effective prevention programmes as well as programmes to assist those in need, especially health workers, whose work contributes significantly to maintaining public health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Given the limited availability of research on the association between COVID-19 infection and breastfeeding success, the primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this relationship. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 260 women who were on the postnatal ward of an academic hospital affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and August 2021). Among these women, 130 had tested positive for COVID-19 in pregnancy, while the remaining 130 were considered healthy. The study aimed to assess various factors, including sociodemographic characteristics and the results of four validated questionnaires: The Bristol Breastfeeding Questionnaire, The Multidimensional of Perceived Social Support (MPSS), The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES), and The Postpartum Partner Support Scale (PPSS). These questionnaires were administered to each participant to gather relevant data. After eight weeks, a telephone follow-up was carried out to assess the success of breastfeeding. The evaluation focused on determining if exclusive breastfeeding was maintained or not. Data was collected by questioning mothers about their infants' feeding habits in the past 24 h. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to the exclusive use of breast milk without the introduction of other liquids or solid foods. RESULTS: Women with a previous COVID-19 infection (case group) had a lower mean infant gestational age (P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of cesarean section (P = 0.001) compared to the control group. The proportion of women who exclusively breastfed was higher in the control group (98.5%) than in women with a history of COVID-19 infection (89.2%) (P = 0.011). Furthermore, the case group reported lower scores in perceived social support and the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, in contrast to the control group. Notably, there was a significant correlation between breastfeeding success and women's breastfeeding self-efficacy score. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study offer valuable insights for healthcare professionals, enabling them to promote early initiation of breastfeeding in mothers with a history of COVID-19 infection, while ensuring necessary precautions are taken.

N2  - Efforts to expand access to health insurance in the United States are key to addressing health inequities and ensuring that all individuals have access to health care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Yet, attempts to expand public insurance programs, including Medicaid, continue to face opposition in state and federal policymaking. Limited policy success raises questions about the health insurance information environment and the extent that available information signals both available resources and the need for policy reform. In this study, we explore one way that consumers and policymakers learn about health insurance—television advertisements—and analyze content in ads that could contribute to an understanding of who needs health insurance or who deserves to benefit from policies to expand insurance access. Specifically, we implement a content analysis of health insurance ads airing throughout 2018 on broadcast television or national cable, focusing on the depictions of people in those ads. Our findings indicate that individuals depicted in ads for Medicaid plans differ from those in ads for non-Medicaid plans. Groups that comprise large populations of current Medicaid enrollees, children and pregnant people, were more likely to appear in ads for non-Medicaid plans than in ads for Medicaid plans. This has implications for potential enrollees' understanding of who is eligible as well as the general public's and policymakers' perspectives on who should be targeted for current or future policies.

N2  - Introduction: Over the past few years, Lebanon—a developing country—has faced a plethora of economic and political challenges, with more than half of the general population presenting depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, when it comes to maternal mental health during pregnancy, the last examination in Lebanon dates far back to 2005. Our study’s aim was to help delineate the factors associated with Lebanese women’s mental health disorders during pregnancy, namely antepartum depression and anxiety. Methods: We launched a cross-sectional study among Lebanese pregnant women (age ≥ 18 years) between June and July 2021, during the COVID-19 lockdown (N = 433). Results: In total, 87.8% of the participants experienced depression (mild to severe), where severe depression was observed in 7.9%. In addition, 70.3% had a significant level of anxiety. Increased pregnancy-specific hassles (beta = 0.93), being Muslim compared to Christians (beta = 3.19), being afraid of an existing aggressor (beta = 8.75), urinary tract infections (beta = 2.02), and higher gestational age (beta = 0.07) were significantly associated with higher depression, whereas higher physical activity index (beta = − 0.09) and increased disordered eating attitudes during pregnancy (beta = − 0.27) were significantly associated with less depression, all accounting for 60.4% of the model’s variance. Additionally, increased pregnancy-specific hassles (beta = 0.54), being Muslim compared to Christians (beta = 2.42), urinary tract infections (beta = 1.72), and having been emotionally or physically abused (beta = 1.19) were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and could predict 49% of the total variance. Conclusion: Our study has suggested the existence of factors that have additive effects in potentiating the risk for depression and anxiety among Lebanese pregnant women, namely cultural beliefs, pregnancy-related distress, medical complications during pregnancy, and a history of abuse. Therefore, it would be judicious to implement screening programs targeting pregnant women at risk for antepartum depression and anxiety. In addition, high rates of prenatal depression and anxiety were detected among our sample, supporting that recognizing and treating maternal mental health disorders should be prioritized during antenatal care in Lebanon.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was reported to cause adverse outcomes. Such knowledge stands low quality evidence due to lack of internal controls and inferential statistics. Objectives: To assess impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy on fetal and neonatal outcomes. Study Design: Prospective analytical cohort study (July 2020 to March 2021). Setting: Level III NICU of teaching hospital in India. Participants: COVID positive mothers (exposed = 239) each matched with 2 women delivered consecutively by same mode without COVID (unexposed = 478) and enrolled at admission during delivery. Procedure: Maternal demographic, comorbidities, and obstetric characteristics; fetal growth, pregnancy complications, and neonatal details of 242 and 482 neonates born to exposed and unexposed mothers respectively were analyzed. Infants were followed until neonatal period. Outcomes: Incidence of prematurity was primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were incidence of abortions, IUD, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, neonatal resuscitation at birth, SFD, NICU admission, neonatal morbidities, length of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, infant positivity rate for SARS COV-2. Results: Incidence of prematurity was not significantly different between mothers with and without COVID-19 infection [42(17.3%) vs 94(19.3%), IRR (95%CI) 1.04(0.83,1.31), P =.833]. Neonatal mortality, adverse fetal outcomes, PROM, fetal distress, SGA, neonatal resuscitation, NICU admission did not differ significantly between groups. Gestational hypertension was associated with COVID-19 infection [14(5.9%) vs 11(2.3%), (p=0.014)]. Infant swab positivity was 7%. Swab positivity and neonatal symptoms were associated significantly (10/17(58.8%) vs 7/17(41.1%), P =.0001). Conclusion: Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection during pregnancy does not increase adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. COVID positive neonates become symptomatic and hence need monitoring in health-care facility.

N2  - Lucknow is one of the most polluted metro-city in India with increasing vehicular density and fuel consumption in the last three decades. The study was conducted during years 2019–2021 for measurement of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), respirable particulate matter (PM10), and noise levels at nine selected sites; 4 residential, 4 commercial, and 1 industrial, encompassing prior-to-lockdown, during-lockdown, and after-lockdown periods. Values of PM10 for prior-to-lockdown, during-lockdown, and after-lockdown period ranged from 133.2 to 197.4, 77.0 to 135.0, and 91.4 to 148.0 µg/m3, respectively while values of PM2.5 were 66.5 to 93.6, 41.9 to 67.5 and 49.5 to 98.6 µg/m3, respectively. Corresponding values of SO2 ranged from 8.7 to 12.8, 5.5 to 7.6, and 11.4 to 17.6 µg/m3, respectively while values of NO2 were 24.6 to 57.0, 20.5 to 32.8, and 26.1 to 43.8 µg/m3, respectively. Order of the trace metals associated with PM2.5 is Co < Cd < As < Cr < Ni < Cu < Pb < Mn < K < Zn, Co < Cd < As < Cr < Cu < Ni < Pb < Mn < Zn < K and Cd < Co < As < Cr < Cu < Ni < Pb < Mn < K < Zn in the same periods. Statistical data evidenced that the air quality of the city witnessed drastic improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO AIRQ + was utilized to calculate attributable health risk and post-neonatal disease burden; showing 1447 ± 768 estimated number of cases attributable to ambient PM10 per lakh of population. Regulatory authorities need to establish new benchmarks for the prevention and management of public health risks for urban resilience and environmental management for episodic events in the near future.

N2  - Background: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated existing health inequities in the United States, but no studies have focused on the lived experiences of younger Black birthing people. The goal of this qualitative study was to center the experiences of younger pregnant and birthing Black and Biracial people during the pandemic. Methods: We recruited 25 Black and Biracial pregnant and birthing people ages 16–23 for individual semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked about experiences with the healthcare system during the pandemic, and interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded for qualitative analysis using nVivo. We adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. Results: Participants identified pandemic-related stressors such as fears about infection, lack of support, and pressure to get vaccinated. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included mistrust in the government and racism experienced during reproductive healthcare. Provider appeals highlighting patient autonomy and science were more effective in encouraging vaccine uptake than emotional appeals that made participants feel guilty about potentially infecting loved ones. Conclusions: Restrictions on children and support people created barriers to timely prenatal care and reduced tangible support for young Black and Biracial birthing people during the pandemic. Their vaccine hesitancy was related to mistrust, concerns that the vaccines had not been tested enough prior to roll-out, and possible side effects of the vaccine including infection with the virus and pregnancy loss. Obstetric providers need to understand and recognize the ongoing impact of obstetric and scientific racism on health communication with younger Black and Biracial patients.

N2  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Asthma symptoms worsen in approximately 40% of women, and exacerbations requiring medical intervention occur in at least 20% of women. Factors associated with exacerbation and worsening asthma include multiparity, obesity, Black race, exacerbations before pregnancy, and poor asthma control. Exacerbations are associated with further increased risks for poor perinatal outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) status, as well as an increase in the development of asthma in early childhood. Common medications used for asthma, including short-acting β-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, are considered safe to use in pregnancy. Whereas guidelines generally suggest traditional step therapy for managing asthma in pregnancy, there are alternative models of care and management approaches that may be effective in pregnancy, but require more research. These include single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy, treatment adjustment with FeNO, treatable traits personalized medicine approaches, and telemedicine. Little is known about changes to asthma in the postpartum period. However, low adherence to medication and the potential effects of postpartum depression on asthma exacerbation risk warrant further research.

N2  - Background: Public health surveillance is crucial in monitoring the progress of maternal, newborn, and children under-five health outcomes (MNCH). Consequently, mapping the existing surveillance system from countries with different income and development levels is needed to learn and compare the effectiveness of surveillance. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the health system, including the healthcare services for pregnant women, neonates, infants, and children under five, as well as the recording, reporting, and surveillance system. The need to adapt to the new normal during the pandemic has stimulated innovation while incorporating new COVID-19-related indicators into the existing public health system. Therefore, this review aims to describe the existing implementation and the COVID-19 pandemic’s influence on the MNCH surveillance system. Methods: We will search published literature (from MEDLINE, Embase, and Portal Garuda), manually search from all reference lists of included studies, and conduct a targeted search of relevant gray literature. This review will include studies of surveillance systems or describe COVID-19 surveillance or routine reports involving MNCH (morbidity and mortality). The studies included will be in English or Indonesian language, observational study designs, and published or documented from 2010 to 2023. Two investigators will independently screen the title and abstract, including each full article to determine the eligibility of studies. The data will be assessed using a narrative approach. Data will be reported in simple descriptive tables. Discussion: Our findings are expected to map the existing implementation of MNCH surveillance systems before and during the pandemic, including the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on MNCH surveillance across countries with different income levels. This may contribute to existing knowledge on the MNCH health surveillance system that could be integrated into the surveillance of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. Systematic review registration: The protocol has been registered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/bc6t4).

N2  - Purpose of Review: Docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are the two essential long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) promoting human health which are obtained from diet or supplementation. The eicosanoids derived from ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs have opposite characteristics of pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. The proinflammatory effects of ω-6 PUFAs are behind the pathology of the adverse health conditions of PUFA metabolism like cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and inflammatory diseases. A balanced ω-6 to ω-3 ratio of 1–4:1 is critical to prevent the associated disorders. But due to modern agricultural practices, there is a disastrous shift in this ratio to 10–20:1. This review primarily aims to discuss the myriad health potentials of ω-3 PUFAs uncovered through recent research. It further manifests the importance of maintaining a balanced ω-6 to ω-3 PUFA ratio. Recent Findings: ω-3 PUFAs exhibit protective effects against diabetes mellitus–associated complications including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and proteinuria. COVID-19 is also not an exception to the health benefits of ω-3 PUFAs. Supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs improved the respiratory and clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Summary: ω-3 PUFAs exhibit a variety of health benefits including anti-inflammatory property and antimicrobial property and are effective in protecting against various health conditions like atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, COVID-19, and neurological disorders. In the present review, various health potentials of ω-3 PUFAs are extensively reviewed and summarized. Further, the importance of a balanced ω-6 to ω-3 PUFA ratio has been emphasized besides stating the diverse sources of ω-3 PUFA.

N2  - Background: Antenatal Education equips parents with knowledge for safe maternal health and infant care. It also reduces fear and anxiety during childbirth. ANE curriculum can vary according to country and institute. It can include classes focusing on childbirth, pain relief techniques, mode of birth, parenting, breastfeeding, breathing techniques, etc. Although ANE is widely practiced in developed countries, there is no standard program in developing countries like Pakistan. This study aims to improve antenatal education at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan potentially proposing an upgraded curriculum as a national standard. Methods: This multiphase study used mix-method design was conducted in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of a tertiary care hospital of Karachi, Pakistan from 2019 to 2021. Phase 1 of the study included reviewing and comparing the hospital’s antenatal curriculum with existing literature, followed by Phase 2, which was a desk review of attendance and patient feedback. The 3rd phase involved IDIs (in depth interviews) from health care workers (Obstetrics experts) to understand their perspectives regarding the ANE and the conducted classes. For phase one, gaps were identified and reported theoretically. For phase two, the annual attendance was recorded and participants’ satisfaction with the classes assessed. Qualitative data from phase 2 and 3 was converted into themes and sub-themes. Results: The audit showed a decline in the attendance of antenatal classes due to the pandemic and consequent shift to online sessions. The low attendance in online courses could be attributed to various factors. Patient feedback was generally positive, with a majority expressing high satisfaction levels. Expert feedback highlighted the need for additional topics such as mental health and COVID in pregnancy, as well as fathers' involvement. The curriculum was updated to include these topics and made more interactive with printed handouts for parents. Conclusion: A standardized antenatal education covering various topics surrounding pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal care must be available to parents nationwide.

N2  - Background: Initiation of antenatal care during the first trimester is crucial for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, only 24% of pregnant women in Malawi initiate antenatal care during this time with even lower rates of 15% at Area 25 Health Centre in Lilongwe. Despite such cases, there is little literature on obstacles that prevent women from accessing first-trimester antenatal care in Malawi. Aim: To explore perceptions of pregnant women and how they influence antenatal care visits during the first trimester at Area 25 Health Centre in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods: We employed a qualitative exploratory study on 55 purposely identified participants. The participants were aged between 18 and 37 years with a gestational period of 36 weeks and below and attended antenatal care at Area 25 Health Centre in Lilongwe Urban, Malawi. Data were collected by MN and 2 data collectors from 19th March 2021 to 16th April 2021 through a total of 15 In-depth Interviews (IDIs) and four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Data were manually analysed using thematic analysis, which included categorization and deductive theme identification with reference to the study objectives and the Health Belief Model (HBM). Results: Pregnant women perceived that the first-trimester antenatal care visits were only for those experiencing ill health conditions like backache, headache, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. First-trimester pregnancy was perceived as too small and not worthy of seeking antenatal care; the women placed a low value on it. The majority of those who initiated antenatal care in the first trimester had previously experienced disorders and complications such as previous cesarean sections and abortions. In addition to limited knowledge about the required total number of ANC visits, challenges such as long-distance, preoccupation with business, multiple antenatal visits, scheduling of antenatal care visits, negative attitude of health workers, adherence to COVID-19 containment measures, and inadequate partner support, were identified as barriers to seeking antenatal care during the first trimester. Conclusion: The negative perceptions among pregnant women, coupled with various health systems, socio-economic and individual barriers, contributed to low attendance rates for first trimester antenatal care in Malawi. Addressing knowledge gaps and overcoming barriers related to economic, individual and health care delivery can improve women’s early antenatal care visits. Future research should consider the pregnant women from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to gain a better understanding of these perceptions and barriers.

N2  - Background: Given the critical importance of mental health in mothers of preterm neonates during the postpartum period for Population Youth Programs, our research aims to ascertain the correlation between postnatal distress and corona-induced anxiety in women who have hospitalized preterm neonates. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted with a sample of 275 mothers of preterm neonates, were hospitalized in Gorgan city in 2020. Data collection was facilitated through the Corona Anxiety (CA) and Postnatal Distress Measured Scale (PDM). For data analysis, Spearman’s correlation and univariate and multiple linear regression were employed. Results: The average age of the participating mothers was 28.61 ± 6.173 years, and the average gestational age of the neonates was 32.8 ± 2.89 weeks. The study found a significant, positive correlation between CA and PDM. Controlling for other variables through multiple regression analysis, the factors that significantly influenced PDM were employment status (β = 3.88, p < 0.01), education level (β = 1.96, p = 0.032), and gestational age (β=-0.60, p < 0.001). Furthermore, number of living children (β=-4.77, p = 0.01), education (β=-2.37, p = 0.01), and gestational age (β=-0.91, p < 0.001) were the factors that were significantly associated with CA scores. Conclusions: The correlation between CA and PDM suggests that preterm neonate’s mothers experienced increased anxiety during the pandemic. Considering the factors influencing these anxieties, targeted programs should be developed to enhance the mental health of these mothers in future pandemics. The finding that women with more children experienced less CA could serve as evidence of the positive impact of having children on the mental health of women with premature infants during a pandemic.

N2  - Background and purpose: The coronavirus epidemic has had a significant impact on people's lives and has created many problems in the economic, scientific, environmental, and personal dimensions of people's lives. Fertility in women was one of the threats addressed during the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life, marital satisfaction, and anxiety, depression, and stress in women of reproductive age referring to medical centers covered by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The current study was descriptive and analytical in a cross-sectional manner. The statistical population included all women referred to medical centers covered by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences from March 1399 to March 1400, who were questioned in two periods. Data were collected using a questionnaire that included demographic information, pregnancy, and COVID-19 disease. Also, the information related to the quality of life of the participants in the study was evaluated using the SF-12 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, and stress of the participants with the Lovebond scale (DASS), and marital satisfaction with the Enrich questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 24 software. Results: 1759 women of reproductive age participated in this study. All participants (100%) were married, with an average duration of marriage of 8.5±1.5 years. 14.1% of women were infected with COVID-19 during the study. 7.2% of women had at least one underlying disease, hypothyroidism (4.3%), diabetes (1.3%) and hypertension (0.1%) being the most common cases. There were diseases. The results indicated a decrease in people's physical health and emotional problems due to the changes in their quality of life due to the outbreak of Covid-19. About 99% of women showed mild and moderate symptoms of mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress, during the study. The participants' stress levels decreased over time (9.6±8.83 vs 8.3±69.7), and their marital satisfaction increased (2.91±0.3 vs 2.95±0.31, P=0.0). Also, the findings of the research showed that people's quality of life had a negative and significant relationship with the amount of mental disorders. Conclusion: The results of the study revealed an increase in marital satisfaction during the Covid-19 period. The study participants' quality of life had a significant difference in the two time periods. Consequently, special attention to Women of reproductive age, increasing their general and sexual awareness, and providing positive psychological programs in crisis conditions are recommended in formulating health policies and programs.

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused various disruptions to NHS maternity services in England. Changes were made to antenatal and postnatal care and the way that information was shared with maternity service users during these times. Fewer face-to-face appointments, increased virtual appointments and changes in guidance about the suitability of the COVID-19 vaccine without appropriate information sharing and evidence caused concern. Methods: This study took a blended inductive-deductive approach to secondary data analysis using a population subset of 16 from a wider study that sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on maternity services in England. Participants of this study were aged 28–44 and gave birth using NHS maternity services in England. The data were collected and coded using Rapid Analysis Procedure sheets, which generated key themes, which are used here to structure the results. Results: Four main themes were generated from the analysis: 1) service restrictions to antenatal and postnatal appointments 2) access to information and changes to antenatal and postnatal care 3) inconsistencies in the implementation of government and NHS policy and 4) limited information about COVID-19 vaccine provided by NHS trusts and hesitancy in vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Participants experienced poor communication that affected their understanding of maternity service changes and there was limited general and maternal health information provided. Vaccine information was also inadequate, and participants expressed a desire for clearer guidance. The UK Government, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and NHS must collaborate with maternity service users to ensure that there are evidence-based guidelines and policies that can be understood and standardised across all NHS maternity trusts.

N2  - Background: The pregnancy and lactation periods are special times when individuals are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Breastfeeding individuals like pregnant women are at a higher risk of experiencing symptoms and requiring hospitalization, including intensive care. Therefore, vaccination is considered the most effective approach to help pregnant and lactating women cope with COVID-19. Despite recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, the coverage among lactating mothers has been insufficient. Objectives: This cross-sectional comparative study aimed to determine the chance of COVID-19 vaccination among lactating women with associated variables such as COVID-19 fear, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and some demographic characteristics. Methods: A total of 450 breastfeeding women were included in the study, divided into two groups: those who received the COVID-19 vaccine (n = 225) and those who did not (n = 225). Individuals were 18-49 years old, had an infant aged under 6 months based on the birth card, a single pregnancy, a healthy newborn, and no contraindications to breastfeeding based on electronic health records. After receiving approval from the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences, the participants from health centers in Tehran, Iran, were selected using a multi-stage sampling method. Data were collected using demographic forms including mothers’, babies’, and husbands’ ages, mothers’ and husbands’ educational level and occupation, child number, household economic level, childbirth type, type of baby feeding, history of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 questionnaires, and Dennis’ Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS16 software, employing statistical methods such as independent t-tests, chi-squared tests, and logistic regression. Results: Two groups of breastfeeding women (225 vaccinated) and (225 unvaccinated) were compared regarding demographic characteristics, fear of COVID-19, and self-efficacy in breastfeeding. There were no differences in mothers’ ages, educational levels, baby’s age, childbirth type, husbands’ occupation, household economic level, history of COVID-19 infection, and husband’s age between the two groups. The variables that had a significance level lower than 0.2 were entered into the logistic regression model. The findings from 450 breastfeeding women showed that husbands’ education level (crude odds ratio [OR] = 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.44 [0.19-0.76], P = 0.04), having more than 4 children (OR = 0.56, CI: 0.31-0.89, P = 0.04), and lower fear level of the COVID-19 (OR = 0.90, CI: 0.87-0.94, P<0.001) had higher odds of receiving vaccine than others. So, the type of baby feeding, women’s education level, women’s and their husbands’ occupation, and breastfeeding self-efficacy did not predict receiving vaccination. Conclusions: This study highlights that unvaccinated breastfeeding women have a higher fear of COVID-19 infection, have husbands with lower levels of education, and have fewer children. Vaccination has emerged as a critical topic impacting the health and well-being of communities worldwide. When it comes to unvaccinated breastfeeding women, it is necessary to consider various factors with a holistic perspective. Understanding the importance, safety, and efficacy of vaccines is crucial. So, the decision to vaccinate is personal and should be based on a comprehensive understanding of available information. Unvaccinated breastfeeding women should engage in prevention programs even before that. Both pregnant women and their husbands should be educated in preparation classes for childbirth. Of course, other factors could affect refusal to receive vaccines. These data could help health providers and policymakers in future crises.

N2  - Objectives: Glucocorticoids as a drug class are widely used in the treatment of many conditions including more recently as one of the mainstay treatments for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The physiological adverse effects are well described. However, less is known and understood about the potentially deleterious neuro-cognitive effects of this class of medication. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of the literature using two separate search strategies. The first focussed on the rates of reporting of adverse cognitive effects of glucocorticoid use in randomised controlled trials. The second looked at those studies focussing directly on adverse cognitive effects associated with the use of glucocorticoids. MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library was searched for randomised controlled trials utilising glucocorticoids as a part of a treatment regimen. Additionally, these databases were also used to search for articles looking directly at the adverse cognitive effects of glucocorticoids. Results: Of the forty-three RCTs included as a part of the first search strategy, only one (2.3%) included specific documentation pertaining to cognitive side effects. As a part of the twenty studies included in the second search strategy, eleven of the included studies (55%) were able to demonstrate a correlation between glucocorticoid use and decreased cognition. Most studies within this strategy showed that GCs predominately affected hippocampus-dependent functions such as memory, while sparing executive function and attention. Conclusions: Overall, the data reporting of adverse clinical effects of glucocorticoid use is poor in recent RCTs. Given the demonstrable effect on predominately hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions evident within the literature, more thorough documentation is needed within clinical research to fully appreciate the potentially widespread nature of these effects.

N2  - The persistence of geographic inequities in vaccination coverage often evidences the presence of zero-dose and missed communities and their vulnerabilities to vaccine-preventable diseases. These inequities were exacerbated in many places during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to severe disruptions to vaccination services. Understanding changes in zero-dose prevalence and its associated risk factors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is, therefore, critical to designing effective strategies to reach vulnerable populations. Using data from nationally representative household surveys conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2018, and during the pandemic, in 2021, in Nigeria, we fitted Bayesian geostatistical models to map the distribution of three vaccination coverage indicators: receipt of the first dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1), the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), and any of the four basic vaccines (bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG), oral polio vaccine (OPV0), DTP1, and MCV1), and the corresponding zero-dose estimates independently at a 1 × 1 km resolution and the district level during both time periods. We also explored changes in the factors associated with non-vaccination at the national and regional levels using multilevel logistic regression models. Our results revealed no increases in zero-dose prevalence due to the pandemic at the national level, although considerable increases were observed in a few districts. We found substantial subnational heterogeneities in vaccination coverage and zero-dose prevalence both before and during the pandemic, showing broadly similar patterns in both time periods. Areas with relatively higher zero-dose prevalence occurred mostly in the north and a few places in the south in both time periods. We also found consistent areas of low coverage and high zero-dose prevalence using all three zero-dose indicators, revealing the areas in greatest need. At the national level, risk factors related to socioeconomic/demographic status (e.g., maternal education), maternal access to and utilization of health services, and remoteness were strongly associated with the odds of being zero dose in both time periods, while those related to communication were mostly relevant before the pandemic. These associations were also supported at the regional level, but we additionally identified risk factors specific to zero-dose children in each region; for example, communication and cross-border migration in the northwest. Our findings can help guide tailored strategies to reduce zero-dose prevalence and boost coverage levels in Nigeria.

N2  - The psychosocial and economic i mpact of Covid-19 Pandemic in Mathare slums, Kenya, were adverse which necessitated mitigation strategies to be employed to cushion the most vulnerable and help them cope with the new ‘state of affairs’. The pandemic was characterized by a surge in the respiratory infections, unemployment, households going hungry, gender-based violence in families, child abuse cases and increased rates of teenage pregnancy. Retrospective case study design was employed; secondary data from hospital departments were extracted for analysis from March 2020 to December 2021. Interventions in focus were healt h ser vice provision, gender based and chi ld abuse services, food dist ribution, wet-feeding program, business grants and house rent grants. The most common burden faced by Mathare residents was food insecurity which was mitigated by giving 9,423 Patients' food baskets while 1423 patients enrolled to the wet feeding program. Gender Based Violence services provided doubled in the year 2021 with physical and emotional violence being more common than sexual violence which was at 6.2%. Child abuse services were provided more in the year 2020 and 96 teenage mothers were assisted to go back to school. About 158 families received rent grants; which was a 30.4% increase from the year 2020. There was a 75.5% increase in the year 2021 of residents who received business grants. In a pandemic the effects are beyond health hence it is necessary to manage patients comprehensively using a multi-sectorial approach. However, it is important to put regulations to avoid overdependence.

N2  - Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, acquired, and nonscarring type of hair loss that affects people of every generation and is intractable in severe and relapsing cases. Patients with AA, especially those with greater scalp involvement, have poor health-related quality-of-life scores. Purpose: Following our previous review article in the April 2017 issue of the Journal of Dermatological Science, we aim to provide a pair of review articles on recent progress in multidisciplinary approaches to AA. Main findings: We found more than 1800 publications on AA from July 2016 to December 2022. Conclusions: In this review, we focused on the latest information on the epidemiology, comorbidities, and pathogenesis of AA.

N2  - Background: Family planning benefits maternal–child health, education, and economic wellbeing. Despite global efforts, an unsatisfied demand for family planning persists in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on previous successful partnerships, the aim of this study was to determine whether an educational intervention for religious leaders would increase community knowledge, demand for, and ultimately uptake of family planning. Methods: In this open-label, cluster randomised trial in Tanzania, 24 communities were randomised (1:1) to intervention or control arm. Communities, defined as the catchment area of a single public health facility, were eligible if they were at least 15 km from Mwanza City and had not previously participated in a health intervention for religious leaders. Random allocations were determined by coin toss and were not revealed to clinicians at health facilities in intervention and control communities, nor to the data entry team; however, due to the nature of the intervention, masking of religious leaders in the intervention communities was not possible. All Christian religious institutions were invited to send four leaders to an educational intervention that incorporated cultural, theological, and medical teaching about family planning. The primary outcome was contraceptive uptake at the community health facility during the year post intervention versus the year before the intervention. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03594305. Findings: 75 communities in three districts were assessed for eligibility. 19 communities were excluded and 56 were eligible for study inclusion and were placed in random order to be invited to participate. The first 24 communities that were invited agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the educational intervention either during the trial or after trial completion. Between July 10, 2018 and Dec 11, 2021, we provided the intervention in 12 communities and compared contraceptive uptake with 12 control communities. All were followed up for 12 months. In intervention communities, contraceptive uptake increased by a factor of 1·47 (95% CI 1·41–1·53) in the post-intervention (prospective) versus pre-intervention (historical) year (geometric mean of contraceptive uptake, 466 in the prospective year vs 312 in the historical year), versus 1·24 (95% CI 1·20–1·29) in control communities (geometric mean, 521 in the prospective year vs 429 in the historical year). The rate of change in contraceptive uptake was greater in intervention communities (between-group ratio of geometric mean ratios over time, 1·19 [95% CI 1·12–1·25]; p<0·0001). The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased contraceptive uptake (geometric mean, 365 during the pandemic in communities that had the majority of their prospective 12-month data collection periods occur after March 16, 2020, vs 494 before the pandemic; geometric mean ratio, 0·72 [95% CI 0·57–0·90]; p=0·0040). Interpretation: This intervention offers a scalable model, leveraging influence of trusted religious leaders to increase knowledge and uptake of family planning. New strategies such as this could help to overcome setbacks that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - In March 2020, New York City was the national epicenter of the novel coronavirus in the United States. This article draws on rapid qualitative research from July to October of 2020 with sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) providers who served low-income people from racial and ethnic minority groups in New York State to examine their perceptions of the effects of COVID-related adaptations to care on healthcare access and quality. We found that care delivery protocols during the early months of the pandemic compromised healthcare interactions and clinical experiences by limiting support persons, separating newborns from parents, and restricting care time in hospitals. Additionally, closures of in-person SRH services and prohibitions on prenatal support persons increased obstacles to access and utilization of care. Our intersectional analysis underscores how COVID protocols interacted with other axes of inequality to compound disparities in SRH access and quality of care. Early COVID policies prioritized controlling the risk of viral exposure over the risk of harm from the policies themselves, reflecting zero-sum approaches that we describe as “trading in harms.” Our research thus raises crucial questions about how institutions and governing bodies conceive of, and organize, emergency preparedness. We argue that emergency preparedness must center concerns around racial, class, and gender equity, among others, to foreground the risks and benefits of emergency responses for different groups.

N2  - Background: The live-attenuated influenza virus vector-based intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (dNS1-RBD, Pneucolin; Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, Beijing, China) confers long-lasting and broad protection in animal models and is, to our knowledge, the first COVID-19 mucosal vaccine to enter into human trials, but its efficacy is still unknown. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy (but not the immunogenicity) of dNS1-RBD against COVID-19. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design, phase 3 trial at 33 centres (private or public hospitals, clinical research centres, or Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) in four countries (Colombia, Philippines, South Africa, and Viet Nam). Men and non-pregnant women (aged ≥18 years) were eligible if they had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and if they did not have a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history at screening or if they had received at least one dose of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 6 months or longer before enrolment. Eligible adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two intranasal doses of dNS1-RBD or placebo administered 14 days apart (0·2 mL per dose; 0·1 mL per nasal cavity), with block randomisation via an interactive web-response system, stratified by centre, age group (18–59 years or ≥60 years), and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcomes were safety of dNS1-RBD in the safety population (ie, those who had received at least one dose of dNS1-RBD or placebo) and efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR occurring 15 days or longer after the second dose in the per-protocol population (ie, those who received two doses, were followed up for 15 days or longer after the second dose, and had no major protocol deviations). The success criterion was predefined as vaccine efficacy of more than 30%. This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100051391) and is completed. Findings: Between Dec 16, 2021, and May 31, 2022, 41 620 participants were screened for eligibility and 31 038 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (15 517 in the vaccine group and 15 521 in the placebo group). 30 990 participants who received at least one dose (15 496 vaccine and 15 494 placebo) were included in the safety analysis. The results showed a favourable safety profile, with the most common local adverse reaction being rhinorrhoea (578 [3·7%] of 15 500 vaccine recipients and 546 [3·5%] of 15 490 placebo recipients) and the most common systemic reaction being headache (829 [5·3%] vaccine recipients and 797 [5·1%] placebo recipients). We found no differences in the incidences of adverse reactions between participants in the vaccine and placebo groups. No vaccination-related serious adverse events or deaths were observed. Among 30 290 participants who received two doses, 25 742 were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis (12 840 vaccine and 12 902 placebo). The incidence of confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by omicron variants regardless of immunisation history was 1·6% in the vaccine group and 2·3% in the placebo group, resulting in an overall vaccine efficacy of 28·2% (95% CI 3·4–46·6), with a median follow-up duration of 161 days. Interpretation: Although this trial did not meet the predefined efficacy criteria for success, dNS1-RBD was well tolerated and protective against omicron variants, both as a primary immunisation and as a heterologous booster.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To quantify pandemic-related changes in obstetric intervention and perinatal outcomes in the United States.METHODS:We carried out a retrospective study of all live births and fetal deaths in the United States, 2015-2021, with data obtained from the natality, fetal death, and linked live birth-infant death files of the National Center for Health Statistics. Analyses were carried out among all singletons; singletons of patients with prepregnancy diabetes, prepregnancy hypertension, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and twins. Outcomes of interest included preterm birth, preterm labor induction or preterm cesarean delivery, macrosomia, postterm birth, and perinatal death. Interrupted time series analyses were used to estimate changes in the prepandemic period (January 2015-February 2020), at pandemic onset (March 2020), and in the pandemic period (March 2020-December 2021).RESULTS:The study population included 26,604,392 live births and 155,214 stillbirths. The prepandemic period was characterized by temporal increases in preterm birth and preterm labor induction or cesarean delivery rates and temporal reductions in macrosomia, postterm birth, and perinatal mortality. Pandemic onset was associated with absolute decreases in preterm birth (decrease of 0.322/100 live births, 95% CI 0.506-0.139) and preterm labor induction or cesarean delivery (decrease of 0.190/100 live births, 95% CI 0.334-0.047) and absolute increases in macrosomia (increase of 0.046/100 live births), postterm birth (increase of 0.015/100 live births), and perinatal death (increase of 0.501/1,000 total births, 95% CI 0.220-0.783). These changes were larger in subpopulations at high risk (eg, among singletons of patients with prepregnancy diabetes). Among singletons of patients with prepregnancy diabetes, pandemic onset was associated with a decrease in preterm birth (decrease of 1.634/100 live births) and preterm labor induction or cesarean delivery (decrease of 1.521/100 live births) and increases in macrosomia (increase of 0.328/100 live births) and perinatal death (increase of 9.840/1,000 total births, 95% CI 3.933-15.75). Most changes were reversed in the months after pandemic onset.CONCLUSION:The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with a transient decrease in obstetric intervention (especially preterm labor induction or cesarean delivery) and a transient increase in perinatal mortality.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To compare contraceptive provision to women with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid.METHODS:Our retrospective cohort study used 2019 North Carolina Medicaid claims to identify women aged 15-44 years with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities at risk for pregnancy who were continuously enrolled during 2019 or had Family Planning Medicaid with at least one claim. We calculated the proportion in each cohort who received 1) most or moderately effective contraception, 2) long-acting reversible contraception, 3) short-acting contraception, and 4) individual methods. We classified contraceptive receipt by procedure type and disaggregated across sociodemographic characteristics. Adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, and urban or rural setting, we constructed logistic regression models to estimate most or moderately effective contraceptive provision odds by intellectual and developmental disability status and by level or type of intellectual and developmental disability. We performed subanalyses to estimate co-occurrence of provision and menstrual disorders.RESULTS:Among 9,508 women with intellectual and developmental disabilities and 299,978 without, a significantly smaller proportion with intellectual and developmental disabilities received most or moderately effective contraception (30.1% vs 36.3%, P<.001). With the exception of injectable contraception, this trend was consistent across all measures and remained statistically significant after controlling for race, ethnicity, age, and urban or rural status (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.72-0.79; P<.001). Among those who received most or moderately effective contraception, a significantly greater proportion of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities had co-occurring menstrual disorders (31.3% vs 24.3%, P<.001).CONCLUSION:These findings suggest disparities in contraceptive provision and potential differences in clinical indication by intellectual and developmental disability status. Future studies should investigate reasons for and barriers to contraceptive use among women with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

N2  - INTRODUCTION:Given variability in parental leave policies in gastroenterology (GI) with little data on outcomes, the American College of Gastroenterology conducted a survey to assess policies and outcomes.METHODS:A survey was distributed to American College of Gastroenterology members with questions on demographics, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and parental leave policies.RESULTS:There were 796 responses, with 52.5% female individuals. Many (57%) delayed parenting. High rates of infertility (21%) and pregnancy complications (68%) were observed. Satisfaction with parental leave policies in GI was low (35%).DISCUSSION:Our survey highlights the need for policies that support the well-being of our GI colleagues and families.

N2  - Importance Pregnancy induces unique physiologic changes to the immune response and hormonal changes leading to plausible differences in the risk of developing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or Long COVID. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy may also have long-term ramifications for exposed offspring, and it is critical to evaluate the health outcomes of exposed children. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Multi-site Observational Study of PASC aims to evaluate the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various populations. RECOVER-Pregnancy was designed specifically to address long-term outcomes in maternal-child dyads. Methods RECOVER-Pregnancy cohort is a combined prospective and retrospective cohort that proposes to enroll 2,300 individuals with a pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and their offspring exposed and unexposed in utero, including single and multiple gestations. Enrollment will occur both in person at 27 sites through the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Health Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network and remotely through national recruitment by the study team at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy are eligible for enrollment in the pregnancy cohort and will follow the protocol for RECOVER-Adult including validated screening tools, laboratory analyses and symptom questionnaires followed by more in-depth phenotyping of PASC on a subset of the overall cohort. Offspring exposed and unexposed in utero to SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection will undergo screening tests for neurodevelopment and other health outcomes at 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months of age. Blood specimens will be collected at 24 months of age for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, storage and anticipated later analyses proposed by RECOVER and other investigators. Discussion RECOVER-Pregnancy will address whether having SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy modifies the risk factors, prevalence, and phenotype of PASC. The pregnancy cohort will also establish whether there are increased risks of adverse long-term outcomes among children exposed in utero.

N2  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals have experienced a variety of mental health challenges. Studies on the anxiety levels of Turkish midwives during the pandemic are limited. The present research aimed to describe the anxiety levels of midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The present research aimed to describe the anxiety levels of midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a web-based basis between 08-29 June 2020. The sample of the study consisted of 606 midwives. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the midwives' anxiety. Results: The mean general anxiety disorder score of the participants in the study was found to be 7.88 ± 5.36. It was observed that 259 (42.7%) showed symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Risk factors for midwives generalized anxiety disorder in COVID-19 pandemi; the state of midwives experiencing anxiety disorder symptoms increases 12.182 times in individuals with a family at risk of COVID-19, and 5.458 times in cases where working hours are 45 hours or more per week (P<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present research, symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder were observed in nearly half of the midwives. Major reasons for anxiety among midwives included having family members in the COVID-19 risk group that they were responsible for and working over standard working hours. Midwives should be protected from the risk of contamination and provided with adequate personal protective equipment, working hours should be improved, and personal empowerment programs should be offered to support them in coping with anxiety.

N2  - In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced unprecedented disruptions in higher education operations. While the adverse mental health effects experienced by college students due to these changes are well documented, less is known about the impact on their sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and the reciprocal relationships between SRH and mental health among adolescents and emerging adults. This position paper reviews existing literature on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SRH, sexual violence, unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted illness and human immunodeficiency virus rates and highlights issues specific to college-aged males, females, racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, and individuals with disabilities. The need to conceptualize SRH as an integral component of normal development, overall health, and well-being in the context of COVID-19 is discussed. The need to prioritize the design and implementation of developmentally appropriate, evidence-based SRH interventions specifically targeting college students is identified. Furthermore, an intergenerational approach to SRH that includes parents/caregivers and/or college faculty and staff (e.g., coaches, trainers) could facilitate comprehensive SRH prevention programming that enhances sexual violence prevention training programs currently mandated by many colleges. Policies and programs designed to mitigate adverse pandemic-related exacerbations in negative SRH outcomes are urgently needed and should be included in mainstream clinical psychology, not only focused on preventing unwanted outcomes but also in promoting rewarding interpersonal relationships and overall well-being. Recommendations for clinical psychologists and mental health researchers are made.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has restricted the use of maternal health services, including prenatal care. Telehealth and telemedicine are remote services that can help in the event of a COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examined the use of telehealth and telemedicine in prenatal care in various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Relevant titles were searched in five e-book databases from 31 December 2019 to 31 July 2021: PUBMED, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar. Articles were chosen based on the following criteria: a focus on pregnant women, a connection to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a focus on telehealth and telemedicine. A narrative synthesis was used to synthesize the data. RESULTS: Telehealth and telemedicine reduced the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to pregnant women and health workers. The implementation process encountered various challenges, such as the absence of service composition, limited technological accessibility, communication difficulties, and disparities in access. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative for the government and health organizations to have a comprehensive policy and legislation that effectively regulates the provision of services. It is also important to emphasize the importance of reducing inequality, such as by equalizing access to technology and infrastructure.

N2  - PURPOSE: Maternal substance use and deaths due to overdoses are increasing nationwide. Evidence suggests that the rate of resumed substance use, and fatal and non-fatal overdose is greatest in the first year after birth, particularly around six months postpartum, compared to other parts of the perinatal period. Doula care has been linked to improvements in perinatal health and outcomes. DESCRIPTION: In response to the opioid epidemic, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health developed and implemented the Doula Support Program (DSP), with a focus on one year of postpartum care for birthing people with a substance use disorder (SUD). In this paper, we describe the program and its formation and report on the early challenges and successes of the program implementation, based on information we received from program founders and managers in a group interview. ASSESSMENT: Early successes of the program include partnering with local community-based programs to recruit and retain doulas, supplementing traditional doula education with perinatal SUD-specific trainings, and maximizing client referrals by collaborating with local organizations and treatment centers that serve birthing people with SUD. Client retention, however, has proven to be challenging, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The DSP continues to grow, and lessons learned will facilitate program improvements. The goal of this paper is to outline the development and launch of the DSP and to act as a model for other state and local health departments interested in providing doula care for birthing people with SUD.

N2  - A young child was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. His hyperactivity, impulsivity and absence of awareness towards danger increased his risk of harm and hence methylphenidate was indicated. Unfortunately, he developed chest pain eight months after the treatment initiation. We then stopped the stimulant and changed his treatment to atomoxetine, after which he no longer had chest pain. In the following illustrated case, we will discuss the cardiac side effect of methylphenidate.

N2  - Background Humanitarian settings, particularly those in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), present increased sexual and reproductive health (SRH) challenges for individuals and health systems. Previous infectious disease outbreaks in such settings have negatively impacted SRH services and outcomes, as fragmented health systems are further overstretched. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the SRH challenges in LMIC humanitarian settings on an unprecedented scale. However, understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 is lacking. This review aimed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted SRH service coverage, utilisation and outcomes in LMIC humanitarian settings, to inform current and future humanitarian research, programming and practice. Methods A systematic review methodology was followed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting standards. Three search fields related to humanitarian settings, SRH and COVID-19 were applied, and limited to LMIC settings only. Three bibliographic databases and nine grey literature sources were searched. Articles meeting inclusion criteria at full-text screening were critically appraised using standardised tools. Data extraction was undertaken on included articles and analysed through narrative synthesis. Results In total, 7742 citations were screened and 42 were included in the review. All included studies were cross-sectional. The quality was mostly medium to high. Narrative synthesis identified the reduced provision of, and access to, SRH services, and increased morbidity including sexual and gender-based violence and unplanned pregnancies. Impacts on service uptake varied across and within settings. Adaptations to improve SRH service access including telemedicine were reported; however, implementation was hindered by resource constraints. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has indirectly negatively impacted SRH at the individual and health system levels in LMIC humanitarian settings. Further research on the impacts on service uptake is required. SRH programmers should target interventions to meet the increased SRH needs identified. Policy-makers must incorporate SRH into emergency preparedness and response planning to mitigate indirect impacts on SRH in future outbreaks.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is a critical health intervention in infants. Recent literature reported that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant mental health issues in pregnant and breastfeeding women due to social isolation and lack of direct professional support. These maternal mental health issues affected infant nutrition and decreased breastfeeding rates during COVID-19. Twitter, a popular social media platform, can provide insight into public perceptions and sentiment about various health-related topics. With evidence of significant mental health issues among women during the COVID-19 pandemic, the perception of infant nutrition, specifically breastfeeding, remains unknown. METHODS: We aimed to understand public perceptions and sentiment regarding breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic through Twitter analysis using natural language processing techniques. We collected and analyzed tweets related to breastfeeding and COVID-19 during the pandemic from January 2020 to May 2022. We used Python software (v3.9.0) for all data processing and analyses. We performed sentiment and emotion analysis of the tweets using natural language processing libraries and topic modeling using an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. RESULTS: We analyzed 40,628 tweets related to breastfeeding and COVID-19 generated by 28,216 users. Emotion analysis revealed predominantly "Positive emotions" regarding breastfeeding, comprising 72% of tweets. The overall tweet sentiment was positive, with a mean weekly sentiment of 0.25 throughout, and was affected by external events. Topic modeling revealed six significant themes related to breastfeeding and COVID-19. Passive immunity through breastfeeding after maternal vaccination had the highest mean positive sentiment score of 0.32. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insight into public perceptions and sentiment regarding breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to other topics we explored in the context of COVID (e.g., ivermectin, disinformation), we found that breastfeeding had an overall positive sentiment during the pandemic despite the documented rise in mental health challenges in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. The wide range of topics on Twitter related to breastfeeding provides an opportunity for active engagement by the medical community and timely dissemination of advice, support, and guidance. Future studies should leverage social media analysis to gain real-time insight into public health topics of importance in child health and apply targeted interventions.

N2  - Introduction: The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on scholarly outcomes and research focus of schools of pharmacy (SOPs) have not been studied. Objectives: To determine how objective measures of scholarly outcomes and research focus changed in pharmacy practice among SOPs, within geographic regions, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: SOPs were included if they appeared on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding list in all four index years (2018–2019: pre-pandemic and 2020–2021: pandemic) and ranked among the top 50 at least once between 2018 and 2021. Names of pharmacy practice faculty were obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) directory. The publication records of each SOP were obtained from Scopus. Scholarly outcome measures were scholarly activity ratio (SAR; proportion of faculty members who published) and scholarly output (SO; number of documents published). Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer®, and Python. Statistical analysis was done in R using a mixed effects model, with the pandemic and geographic regions as fixed effects, and SOPs as the random effect. Results: Fifty-five SOPs and 1343 faculty members were included. Neither the pandemic nor geographic region had significant effects on SAR. However, both variables had significant effects on SO, as demonstrated by an increase in the Midwest during the pandemic (p < 0.05). Documents published increased from 2755 to 3001 during the pandemic. This 8.9% increase was lower than a historical average biennial increase of 24.9%. COVID-19 was the top new research topic, constituting 56.5% of the increase over the pre-pandemic period. Of these COVID-19 publications, 20.9% were education-related. Conclusion: Pharmacy practice faculty engaged in COVID-19 research that focused predominantly on education. Scholarly-active faculty were resilient, but their output was lower than expected based on historical trends. These results support the need to adjust tenure and promotion benchmarks and/or timelines related to scholarly output, especially for tenure-track faculty with probationary periods spanning these pandemic years.

N2  - The growing dependence on social media for health-related information boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, posing unprecedented challenges in navigating the vast amounts of information available right at our fingertips. Social media had a major impact on clinical decision-making affecting individuals, communities, and societies at large. In this review, we discuss the role of social media in amplifying information and misinformation as well as factors contributing to its reliance and prevalence. We review how medical providers have been impacted by this changing landscape, useful communication strategies to employ with in-office patient encounters, and how we can be active players in using social media as a tool for health promotion, correcting misinformation, and preparing for future pandemics.

N2  - Background: Health system shocks are increasing. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in global disruptions to health systems, including maternal and newborn healthcare seeking and provision. Yet evidence on mitigation strategies to protect newborn service delivery is limited. We sought to understand what mitigation strategies were employed to protect small and sick newborn care (SSNC) across 65 facilities Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania, implementing with the NEST360 Alliance, and if any could be maintained post-pandemic. Methods: We used qualitative methods (in-depth interviews n=132, focus group discussions n=15) with purposively sampled neonatal health systems actors in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. Data were collected from September 2021 - August 2022. Topic guides were co-developed with key stakeholders and used to gain a detailed understanding of approaches to protect SSNC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions explored policy development, collaboration and investments, organisation of care, human resources, and technology and device innovations. Interviews were conducted by experienced qualitative researchers and data were collected until saturation was reached. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. A common coding framework was developed, and data were coded via NVivo and analysed using a thematic framework approach. Findings: We identified two pathways via which SSNC was strengthened. The first pathway, COVID-19 specific responses with secondary benefit to SSNC included: rapid policy development and adaptation, new and collaborative funding partnerships, improved oxygen systems, strengthened infection prevention and control practices. The second pathway, health system mitigation strategies during the pandemic, included: enhanced information systems, human resource adaptations, service delivery innovations, e.g., telemedicine, community engagement and more emphasis on planned preventive maintenance of devices. Chronic system weaknesses were also identified that limited the sustainability and institutionalisation of actions to protect SSNC. Conclusion: Innovations to protect SSNC in response to the COVID-19 pandemic should be maintained to support resilience and high-quality routine SSNC delivery. In particular, allocation of resources to sustain high quality and resilient care practices and address remaining gaps for SSNC is critical.

N2  - Seasonal influenza is a leading cause of death in the U.S., causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Despite the proven efficacy of vaccinations, rates remain notably low, especially among Medicaid enrollees. Leveraging Medicaid claims data, this study characterizes influenza vaccination rates among Medicaid enrollees and aims to elucidate factors influencing vaccine uptake, providing insights that might also be applicable to other vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19. This study used Medicaid claims data from nine U.S. states (2016–2021], encompassing three types of claims: fee-for-service, major Medicaid managed care plan, and combined. We included Medicaid enrollees who had an in-person healthcare encounter during an influenza season in this period, excluding those under 6 months of age, over 65 years, or having telehealth-only encounters. Vaccination was the primary outcome, with secondary outcomes involving in-person healthcare encounters. Chi-square tests, multivariable logistic regression, and Fisher’s exact test were utilized for statistical analysis. A total of 20,868,910 enrollees with at least one healthcare encounter in at least one influenza season were included in the study population between 2016 and 2021. Overall, 15% (N = 3,050,471) of enrollees received an influenza vaccine between 2016 and 2021. During peri-COVID periods, there was an increase in vaccination rates among enrollees compared to pre-COVID periods, from 14% to 16%. Children had the highest influenza vaccination rates among all age groups at 29%, whereas only 17% were of 5–17 years, and 10% were of the 18–64 years were vaccinated. We observed differences in the likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine among enrollees based on their health conditions and medical encounters. In a study of Medicaid enrollees across nine states, 15% received an influenza vaccine from July 2016 to June 2021. Vaccination rates rose annually, peaking during peri-COVID seasons. The highest uptake was among children (6 months–4 years), and the lowest was in adults (18–64 years). Female gender, urban residency, and Medicaid-managed care affiliation positively influenced uptake. However, mental health and substance abuse disorders decreased the likelihood. This study, reliant on Medicaid claims data, underscores the need for outreach services.

N2  - Background: COVID-19 has had a dramatic and obvious influence on the mental health of women. Preconception care (PCC) has received a lot of attention as an alternate and supplementary strategy to combat the persistently poor pregnancy outcomes caused by Covid-19 worldwide. Objective: The purpose of the systematic review was to look for PCC interventions to help women have healthier pregnancies. Method: We searched PubMed, Medline, EmBase, the Cochrane library, and Google Scholar for the most recent studies on preconception treatment to enhance pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19 surviving women in March 2023 for this systematic review. The terms [preconception care] AND [pregnancy outcomes] AND [COVID-19 survival women] were used as search criteria. Only articles in the English language were included in searches. Results:1215 duplicate articles were removed from all databases that had been searched after the original search. Moreover, after looking at their titles and abstracts, 1575 publications were dropped from the study. Based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the primary author and co-author examined and chose the remaining 860 articles. Twelve papers that were deemed to be eligible for this study were included. A total of 2983 people took part in the chosen study. Iran (n=3) has published the majority of the chosen studies, followed by the US (n=2), India (n=2), Vietnam (n=2), Ethiopia (n=1), the Netherlands (n=1), and the UK (n=1). Conclusion: Preconception treatment improved the birth outcomes, according to the findings. It may be established that women's pregnancy planning is the real source of the mental health issues.

N2  - Purpose Healthcare workers were recruited early in 2020 to chart effects on their health as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. The aim was to identify modifiable workplace risk factors for infection and mental ill health. Participants Participants were recruited from four Canadian provinces, physicians (medical doctors, MDs) in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs) and healthcare aides (HCAs) in Alberta and personal support workers (PSWs) in Ontario. Volunteers gave blood for serology testing before and after vaccination. Cases with COVID-19 were matched with up to four referents in a nested case-referent study. Findings to date Overall, 4964/5130 (97%) of those recruited joined the longitudinal cohort: 1442 MDs, 3136 RNs, 71 LPNs, 235 PSWs, 80 HCAs. Overall, 3812 (77%) were from Alberta. Prepandemic risk factors for mental ill health and respiratory illness differed markedly by occupation. Participants completed questionnaires at recruitment, fall 2020, spring 2021, spring 2022. By 2022, 4837 remained in the cohort (127 had retired, moved away or died), for a response rate of 89% (4299/4837). 4567/4964 (92%) received at least one vaccine shot: 2752/4567 (60%) gave postvaccine blood samples. Ease of accessing blood collection sites was a strong determinant of participation. Among 533 cases and 1697 referents recruited to the nested case-referent study, risk of infection at work decreased with widespread vaccination. Future plans Serology results (concentration of IgG) together with demographic data will be entered into the publicly accessible database compiled by the Canadian Immunology Task Force. Linkage with provincial administrative health databases will permit case validation, investigation of longer-term sequelae of infection and comparison with community controls. Analysis of the existing dataset will concentrate on effects on IgG of medical condition, medications and stage of pregnancy, and the role of occupational exposures and supports on mental health during the pandemic.

N2  - Background: The covid-19 pandemic sparked a debate about the safety of vaccines during pregnancy. However, pregnant women were excluded from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine phase 3 trials. As two years have passed since the first Covid-19 vaccine and more studies have been conducted, we want to evaluate the scientific literature to determine any actual risks in taking the vaccine during pregnancy. Methods: We conducted literature research using PubMed and Google Scholar databases from January to April 2023. As the review considers short- and long-term adverse effects it was divided into two parts. The first part was conducted as a systematic review. The second concerning long-term negative effects due to lack of research is a literature review. The inclusion criteria for the systematic review part were singleton pregnancies, women vaccinated during pregnancy, and studies from 2020 and later. The most common short-term pregnancy adverse effects were included in the search: preterm delivery, small gestation age, intrauterine death, congenital defects, stillborn, fetal growth retardation, spontaneous abortion. Maternal immune activation was the primary concern for the long-term adverse effects and whether vaccination could cause it. The search terms included maternal immune activation, fetal neurodevelopment, neuropsychiatric disorders and the studies used were from 2019. Results: Most studies showed no significant difference in short-term adverse effects between vaccinated and non-vaccinated women and their fetuses. However, the literature is insufficient to evaluate possible long-term adverse effects. Conclusion: Available evidence supports the safety of administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to pregnant women, but further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential. Maternal immune activation caused by vaccination may impact a child's neurodevelopment and should be a concern for future studies.

N2  - Studies suggest perinatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 can induce adverse birth outcomes, but studies published to date have substantial limitations. We therefore conducted an observational study of 211 births occurring between January 2020-September 2021 in three urban cohorts participating in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes Program. Serology was assessed for IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies to nucleocapsid, S1 spike, S2 spike, and receptor-binding domain. There were no differences in gestational age (GA), birth weight, preterm birth (PTB) or low birth weight (LBW) among seropositive mothers. However, the few (n = 9) IgM seropositive mothers had children with lower BW (434g, 95% CI: 116–752), BW Z score-for-GA (0.73 SD, 95% CI 0.10–1.36) and were more likely to deliver preterm (OR 8.75, 95% CI 1.22–62.4). Though there are limits to interpretation, the data support efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy.

N2  - Background and objective The COVID-19 pandemic impacted every single aspect of life. In addition to being a public health emergency, the COVID-19 outbreak impacted the mental health of individuals, especially pregnant women. This study aimed to examine the mental health status of pregnant women and also the effect of sociodemographic factors on their mental health status during COVID-19 in healthcare centers of Iran. Methods This cross-sectional, analytical-descriptive study was conducted among pregnant women referring to healthcare centers in Shoushtar, Iran, in 2021. Multistage cluster sampling was used to select participants. Data were collected using the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 22. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the association between quantitative variables. A general-ized linear model (GLM) was applied to estimate the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable (mental health). Results A total of 197 participants with a mean ± SD age of 27.85 ± 6.37 years took part in this study. The total mean score of mental health was estimated at 17.47±8.20. The highest mean ± SD score was, respectively, related to social dysfunction (6.63 ± 2.86), anxiety and insomnia (5.28 ± 3.53), and somatic symptoms (4.17 ± 3.27). Mental health disorder was significantly correlated with participants’ age (R = .223, P = .00), number of pregnancy (gravida) (R = .272, P = .00), number of births (para) (R = 0.272, P = .00), and number of abortions (R = .172, P = .015). About 80% of pregnant women did not reveal impaired mental health conditions or psychological distress, while 19.3% showed scores that indicate probable mental health conditions. Conclusion Social dysfunction was the most common mental health problem among pregnant women. It is necessary to pay more attention to the mental health status of pregnant women during a pandemic. Interventions such as practical strategies to promote social support and improve pregnant women’s mental health during pregnancy are highly important.

N2  - Background: We provide new and comprehensive evidence on the evolution of a wide range of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in the NAMSAL ANRS 12313 trial in Cameroon (2016–2021)—the first randomized comparison of dolutegravir 50 mg (DTG) and low-dose efavirenz (ie, 400 mg; EFV400) in treatment-naive adults living with HIV-1 in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We first described the evolution of PROs between baseline and week 192. Then, we used random-effects models to measure the effect of time since the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and the differential effect of DTG versus EFV400 on each PRO, adjusting for clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors, while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and missing data. Results: Among the 613 patients randomized (DTG arm, n = 310; EFV400 arm, n = 303), (1) physical and mental health-related quality of life improved by 13.3% and 6.8%, respectively, (2) the percentage of patients with depression, anxiety, and stress decreased from 23.3%, 23.0%, and 7.7% to 3.1%, 3.5%, and 0.4%, respectively, and (3) the mean number of HIV-related symptoms decreased from 7.2 to 3.0 (P, 0.001). For most PROs, no significant difference was found between both arms, even when accounting for the effect of DTG on weight gain. Nevertheless, our results suggest smaller improvements in mental health outcomes in the DTG arm, with a 5 percentage point higher adjusted probability of having anxiety at week 192 (P, 0.01). Conclusions: Although supporting the current World Health Organization guidelines recommending DTG-based and EFV400-based regimens as preferred and alternative first-line antiretroviral therapy, further studies should investigate medium-term mental health outcomes in patients on DTG.

N2  - There is growing recognition that the public health measures employed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had unintended consequences on socioeconomic security and health inequalities, having the greatest impact on the most vulnerable groups. This longitudinal study aims to explore the medium to long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures on financial security for families living in the deprived and ethnically diverse city of Bradford. We collected data at four time points before and during the pandemic from mothers who participated in one of two prospective birth cohort studies in Bradford. The findings demonstrate that the risk of experiencing financial insecurity rose sharply during the pandemic and has not returned to pre-COVID-19 baseline levels. Several individual characteristics were found to be possible predictors of financial insecurity, including homeowner status, free school meal eligibility and not working. Protective factors against financial insecurity include: living in more affluent areas; greater levels of educational attainment; and families with two or more adults in the household. Notably, families of Pakistani Heritage were found to have the greatest risk of experiencing financial insecurity throughout the pandemic. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that there were strong associations between financial insecurity and maternal health and wellbeing outcomes, with mothers experiencing financial insecurity being more likely to report unsatisfactory general health and clinically important symptoms of depression and anxiety. The findings of this study highlight that the impact of financial insecurity experienced by mothers and their families throughout the pandemic was severe, wide ranging and affected the most vulnerable. In the wake of the pandemic, the emerging cost of living and energy crisis emphasises the urgent need for policy makers to act to support vulnerable families to prevent further widening of existing health and social inequalities.

N2  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial interruptions in critical health services, with 90% of countries reporting interruptions in routine vaccinations, maternal health care and chronic disease management. The use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as lockdowns and self-isolation had implications on the provision of essential health services (EHS). We investigated exemplary COVID-19 outbreak control strategies and explored the extent to which the adoption of these NPIs affected the provision of EHS including immunization coverage and facility-based deliveries. Finally, we document core health system strategies and practices adopted to maintain EHS during the early phase of the pandemic. Methods This study used an explanatory sequential study design. First, we utilized data from routine health management information systems to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the provision of EHS using interrupted time series models. Second, we explored exemplary strategies and health system initiatives that were adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections while maintaining the provision of EHS using in-depth interviews with key informants including policymakers and healthcare providers. Results The COVID-19 pandemic and the interventions that were implemented disrupted the provision of EHS. In the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oral Polio and pentavalent vaccination coverage reduced by 15.2% [95% CI =-22.61,-7.87, p<0.001] and 12.4% [95% CI = 17.68,-7.13; p<0.001] respectively. The exemplary strategies adopted in maintaining the provision of EHS while also responding to the spread of infections include the development of new policy guidelines that were disseminated with modified service delivery models, new treatment and prevention guidelines, the use of telemedicine and medical drones to provide EHS and facilitate rapid testing of suspected cases. Conclusion The implementation of different NPIs during the peak phase of the pandemic disrupted the provision of EHS. However, the Ministry of Health leveraged the resilient health system and deployed efficient, all-inclusive, and integrated infectious disease management and infection prevention control strategies to maintain the provision of EHS while responding to the spread of infections.

N2  - Objective: Thyroid disorders significantly impact maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, with thyroid hormone balance being crucial for fetal development. Hypothyroidism, a common disorder among women of childbearing age, can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including subtle thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune conditions. Diagnosing thyroid disorders in pregnancy is challenging due to overlapping symptoms with normal pregnancy changes and various contributing factors. Methods: In this prospective observational study conducted in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, we focused on pregnant women attending the first-trimester antenatal clinic. Inclusion criteria comprised pregnant women aged 18 or older, regardless of their gravidity and parity, who provided informed consent. Exclusions were made for comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, renal or liver disease, multifetal gestation, and previous bad obstetric history. A total of 300 hypothyroid pregnant women were selected through convenience sampling. We assessed serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels using chemiluminescent microplate immunoassay (CMIA) and administered adequate L thyroxine treatment to maintain TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/l. Results: Maternal outcomes exhibited variation, with common delivery methods being cesarean sections (both emergency and elective) and normal vaginal deliveries. Some pregnancies faced complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, and placenta previa. Neonatal outcomes ranged from healthy newborns to those with low Apgar scores, intrauterine demise, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Adequate treatment with L thyroxine was observed in 60.6% of cases, emphasizing the need for improved hypothyroidism management during pregnancy. Conclusion: Our study underscores the diversity of maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with hypothyroidism during pregnancy in a hilly region of India. Early detection, comprehensive antenatal care, and optimal thyroid hormone management are vital to minimize complications and promote the well-being of both mothers and newborns. Further research and awareness campaigns are essential for enhancing thyroid disorder screening and management in pregnancy.

N2  - Today, technology has an important impact on the development of medical services, especially during the outbreak of COVID-19. Telemedicine, known by terms such as telehealth and digital health, refers to the utilization of technology to provide health care services at a distance that leads to improved monitoring, detecting and treatment of disease, and provision of individual care. It has been considered in various fields such as radiology, cardiology, pulmonology, psychiatry, emergency care and surgery. The most important advantages of using telemedicine are saving time for the doctor and the patient, reducing the cost of multiple visits to the doctor, reducing the spread of contagious diseases and caring for patients who cannot see a doctor, such as the elderly. In this paper, we review the research in the field of applying telemedicine, as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Next, we discuss the challenges in the field of using telemedicine which are privacy preserving, data security, cost of infrastructures, lack of physical examination and responsibility for patients’ compensation. One of the most important challenges is privacy preserving of patients’ information during transmission and process. We categorize and compare the various methods that have been proposed to protect peoples’ privacy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Concerns about the housing of migrants and asylum seekers have escalated since the COVID-19 pandemic. From the use of quasi-detention facilities and so-called contingency accommodation to outbreaks of diphtheria in processing centres, there is a worrying trend to normalise potentially damaging conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the health risks posed by contingency housing for asylum seekers in the UK. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, a 10-point online questionnaire was sent to professional networks working with refugees and asylum seekers within the UK. Responses were collected between March 4, and April 11, 2022, using a mixture of convenience and snowballing sampling approach. The objectives of the survey were (1) to identify and document unmet needs, (2) to offer practical support, and (3) to map out services and organisation. The survey was designed by six medical professionals with experience of working with migrants and validated by three doctors who had experience running out-reach medical clinics for asylum seekers within contingency accommodation. Background details of geographical location and occupation were collected, and a combination of closed and open questions were used to collect information across five domains (medical, legal social, integration, and basic essentials) using a social determinants of health framework. A code book thematic analysis using a deductive/inductive hybrid approach was used to identify health and social needs as well as specific rights being denied. FINDINGS: There were 68 responses from around the UK, of which 30 (44%) were health-care professionals, and 38 (56%) were from the wider voluntary sector. 45 (67%) had visited an accommodation site, and 21 (33%) had worked with those living in contingency accommodation in other respects. Respondents reported observations regarding sites across most parts of the UK. Major themes of access to health-care, access to other services, barriers to access, and safeguarding were identified, with subthemes on access to primary care, maternity, and mental health services (eg, "Vast unmet need in mental health provision, several suicide attempts"); access to basic essential services (eg, "Food was not fit for purpose" "[c]hildren often did not receive breakfast"); education, and legal support; and frequent moving and communication. INTERPRETATION: Through several themes we highlight the substantial impact of structural isolation of asylum seekers through contingency housing, its major effects on wellbeing and the exacerbation of health inequities. We are using these results to work with asylum seekers and local non-governmental organisations to campaign for improved housing conditions. Study limitations include sampling bias, and a lack of voices of those with lived experience.None.

N2  - Background: Separating women with the coronavirus 2019 from family can affect marital life. Considering psychological vulnerability of women for anxiety and depression disorders, these women may experience more stress due to the loss of work at this time or special reproductive health conditions such as pregnancy, having a baby, or other medical conditions. Objective: Considering a limited number of qualitative studies on the need for marital intimacy, this study was conducted to meet marital intimacy needs in women with coronavirus 2019. Materials and Methods: Framework qualitative content analysis was conducted through participation of 13 key informants (sex therapist, couple therapist, psychologist, and midwifery counselor) and 18 infected women from Yazd, Iran in July 2020 who were selected purposefully and interviewed through the semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results: 3 main categories were: 1) mutual resilience (subcategories: 1. coping strategies; 2. value of marital life; 3. compassionate conflict resolving). 2) skillful relationship (subcategories: 1. assertiveness in sexual expression; 2. self-efficacy in the distance physical connectivity). 3) synergy (subcategories: 1. reframing spirituality closeness; 2. empowering aesthetic creativity; 3. management of family function, and 4. prioritizing). Conclusion: Findings revealed sex and couple therapists, health providers, and policymakers should emphasize on using new forms of digital communication in these couples. Teaching skills that increase partners’ creativity and empathy, enable women to fulfill their mental, sexual and reproductive health needs, and lead to more partners responsibility and loyalty, and maintenance of family function. In times of crisis, counseling should be considered in women treatment programs and care guidelines.

N2  - Importance: Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality. Observations: The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L. Conclusions and Relevance: Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered..

N2  - During pregnancy, SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) can be complicated, and the mother and neonate’s prognosis is not fully documented. We are presenting the case of a 33-week pregnant patient with confirmed COVID-19 who developed encephalopathy. During the disease and hospitalization in a critical care setting, an emergency C-section was performed with general anesthesia in the ICU due to acidosis and maternal-fetal instability. The baby boy was delivered with an APGAR score of 8, showing no obvious anomalies, and was subsequently intubated. Eight days later, brain imaging revealed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The mother received treatment and was discharged without further complications. At the final follow-up six months after discharge, the patient’s MRI showed laminar necrosis in the two occipitoparietal cortex areas. However, she remained symptom-free and did not report any complications. We also discussed the possible reasons for these findings and their relationship to the infection.

N2  - Perinatal depression and postpartum depression represent a significant burden for those who experience them and are associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, postpartum hospitalization, diminished mother-child relationships, offspring developmental delay, and other important markers of health and well-being. Perinatal depression, in particular, is underidentified and thus undertreated. This study was designed to assess the MMB eHealth program (MomMoodBooster2 [MMB2]), which is targeted toward perinatal depression, with an aim to assess the effectiveness of the smartphone version of this tool. Primary outcomes were targeted toward analyzing the extent to which MMB2 relieved the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in general (using both perinatal and postpartum tools); secondary outcomes focused on usage trends along with ratings of usability and helpfulness. Participants were recruited from the Perinatal Depression Program (PDP) in the NorthShore University HealthSystem. Eligibility criteria included pregnant women and women less than a year postpartum, age older than 18 years, no active suicidal ideation, access to internet, and English language proficiency. REDCap (Vanderbilt University Nashville, Tenn) was used for onboarding and randomization. Final analyses included 191 patients randomized into 2 groups, one with MMB2 and the PDP protocol and one with only PDP. After program completion, 93% of patients completed an associated posttest. Primary screenings were not significantly different between groups, and baseline characteristics were likewise consistent. Controlling for perinatal status, posttests showed a significant decrease in depression severity, anxiety, stress, and automatic thoughts (P ≤ 0.001), as well as an increase in behavioral activation and self-efficacy. Further analysis showed that the MMB2 group showed greater decreases from baseline to posttest in both stress (P = 0.019) and depression severity (P = 0.003). No other significant effects were found when comparing the 2 groups. Usage of MMB2 varied, but generally showed that patients visited the program shortly after receiving the first invitation and then periodically on multiple distinct days between their first and last visit to their health care provider (mean [SD] visits, 49.4 [30.2] distinct days). Perinatal tools were used by 41% of participants, and 43% used postpartum tools, with 10% using both tools because of being pregnant at initial recruitment but delivering over the course of the study. The program included text messages for the first 12 weeks, and impact of these was not directly assessed. Of ratings provided, 96% rated the program as "somewhat"to "extremely"easy to use, and 83% of participants rated it as "somewhat"to "extremely"helpful. Many participants in both groups reported using other management strategies such as medication, therapy sessions, and physician advice, but use of these interventions did not differ between groups. These results indicate that MMB2 is effective at reducing anxiety and depression severity, as well as improving self-efficacy. Clinically, this eHealth tool may be an appropriate way to subsidize care for women where in-person options are limited or other options are unavailable. It could also be used to augment in-person options for management of depressive symptoms. Further research should focus on larger and more diverse populations, to understand if the findings are generalizable beyond this small population. In addition, the sustainability and adoption strategies should be optimized to allow this program to be as far reaching as possible. More research could also examine long-term follow-up and durability of the effects of this treatment.

N2  - Many illnesses can become especially serious when contracted within the first year of life; pertussis remains quite deadly despite recent medical advances in disease prevention. Current guidance on vaccination in the United States includes 3 doses of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccine beginning at 2 months of age, but this regimen leaves infants younger than that very vulnerable to illness. Research has shown both that vaccinating mothers with tetanus toxoid reduces tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation significantly reduces instances of pertussis in infants younger than 2 months, and that maternal vaccination rates have risen in the last few years. However, research is lacking in analyzing the relationship between vaccination rates in pregnant mothers and the burden of pertussis in infants in the United States. This study was designed to assess data from 2000 to 2019 and examine the association of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy with trends in infant pertussis. This analysis included data obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System between 2000 and 2019. This included a total of 57,460 cases of pertussis in infants younger than 1 year and a total of 19,322 cases in infants younger than 2 months. The rate of pertussis incidence for infants younger than 2 months in the time period before the implementation of prenatal Tdap was calculated to be 165.3 per 100,000 individuals, with no significant trend observed annually (P = 0.28). After the implementation of routine maternal Tdap, incidence decreased to 80.9 per 100,000 infants between 2017 and 2019. Accounting for both time periods, the mean annual incidence was calculated as 121.8 per 100,000 infants younger than 2 months. Annual incidence also showed a significant decreasing trend in the period after implementation of maternal Tdap vaccination (slope: -14.53 per 100,000 infants per year; P = 0.001). The change in trends before and after this implementation was also significant (P = 0.01). In a slightly older age group of 6 to 12 months of age, mean annual incidence of pertussis was 19.7 per 100,000 infants. In the time period before implementation of maternal Tdap, incidence among infants aged 6 to 12 months was consistently 4 to 12 times less than infants younger than 2 months and did not significantly change after the implementation of the maternal vaccine. Comparing the 2 age groups, there was no significant change in the difference in incidence between infants younger than 2 months and those between 6 and 12 months in the period before the maternal vaccine, and after its implementation, there was a significant decrease in the incidence difference between the 2 groups (P < 0.001). These results suggest an association between the maternal Tdap vaccination and trends of pertussis incidence in infants younger than 2 months. This also indicates a possible reduction in disease burden attributable to maternal Tdap vaccination before delivery. Limitations of this study include limited availability of individual maternal vaccination status, as well as an inability to identify if any infants were vaccinated before the age of 2 months. Further research should focus on clinical impact of the Tdap vaccination in context with the later DTaP vaccination and on analyzing the trends in disease associated with both vaccinations. Clinical guidelines should also be examined to ensure that public health trends and individual health trends are in alignment.

N2  - Background and purpose The WHO declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and the word ‘pandemic’ was first used to describe the disease’s global spread in March of that year. Chronic lung disease (19.2% was the most common co-occurring condition with COVID-19), at 20.8%, followed by chronic kidney disease (20.8%), and then cardiovascular disease (60.9%). This research aimed to assess the prognosis of COVID-19confirmed cases receiving isolation care at Hurghada General Hospital. Study design An observational study that was retrospective and cross-sectional. Setting Isolation department in Hurghada General Hospital. Patients We included 122 patients with COVID-19 infection, and classified them into two independent groups: the improvement group (93 patients), and the morbidity (complication) and mortality group (29 patients). Methods Clinical data (COVID-19 symptoms and vital signs), laboratory data (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, ferritin level in the blood, hepatic and renal functions tests, coagulation profile, and level of D-dimer), radiological data (computed tomography of the chest), and drug and antibiotic data were collected from all patients. The following parameters were assessed in each patient: length of hospital stay, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, morbidity (complication), mortality, improvement, and discharge. Results Patients’ average age in the sample was 55 ± 16.3 years. Regarding patients’ respective sexes, 55.7% of patients were females, while 44.3% were males. Regarding the final outcome data, the average length of hospital stay was 9.2 ± 6.2 days, with 33.6% of patients having ICU admission, 9% were ventilated, morbidity(16.4%) (complication) (4.9% psychological and neurological disorders, 3.3% post-COVID oxygen-dependent therapy, 8.2% renal impairment), and mortality (7.4%), while 76.2% had improved and discharged. Logistic regression results demonstrated that the increase in age, BMI, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, computed tomography chest affection, and COVID-19 severity (according to clinical, laboratory and radiological data); added to the risk of needing to be admitted to a hospital’s ICU on its own (P<0.05, respectively). Decreases in oxygen saturation, urea, and prothrombin time were found to independently increase the likelihood of ICU admission in a logistic regression analysis (P<0.05). Conclusion We conclude that age and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and lung fibrosis are strongly related to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hurghada Isolation Hospital. It was also more likely that those patients would develop acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe pneumonia. Strict treatment protocol and isolation lead to better outcomes.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women need correct information and skills for effective self-care and improved self-efficacy during pregnancy. Maternal training will raise women's awareness of pregnancy and childbirth, leading to higher self-efficacy. Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the impact of telehealth on pregnant women's self-care, self-efficacy, and satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This quasi-experimental study involved low-risk pregnant women selected from prenatal public clinics in Ahvaz, Iran. Eligible pregnant women (n=150) were assigned to three groups: WhatsApp training (n=50), phone call training (n=50), and control (n=50). Women in the three groups received four face-to-face prenatal care sessions based on the content recommended by the Iranian Ministry of Health. In addition to these four face-to-face sessions, four more virtual training sessions were held for the WhatsApp and phone call groups. Results: Raising the awareness of pregnant women through telephone counseling was found to not only increase their self-efficacy, self-care, and satisfaction but also reduce the need for in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a moderate positive correlation was observed between self-efficacy and self-care scores; moreover, they have a relatively negative weak correlation with face-to-face visits. Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that most pregnant women were satisfied with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thanks to this type of care provision, their self-efficacy and self-care levels were high. Reduced face-to-face visits during the pandemic are the main advantage of telehealth.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with severe COVID-19 and adverse fetal outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Moreover, clinical studies assessing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are limited. To address these gaps, we developed a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Outbred CD1 mice were infected at E6, E10, or E16 with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (maSCV2) virus. Outcomes were gestational age–dependent, with greater morbidity, reduced antiviral immunity, greater viral titers, and impaired fetal growth and neurodevelopment occurring with infection at E16 (third trimester equivalent) than with infection at either E6 (first trimester equivalent) or E10 (second trimester equivalent). To assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, which is recommended for individuals who are pregnant with COVID-19, we treated E16-infected dams with mouse-equivalent doses of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Treatment reduced pulmonary viral titers, decreased maternal morbidity, and prevented offspring growth restriction and neurodevelopmental impairments. Our results highlight that severe COVID-19 during pregnancy and fetal growth restriction is associated with heightened virus replication in maternal lungs. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir mitigated maternal morbidity along with fetal growth and neurodevelopment restriction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings prompt the need for further consideration of pregnancy in preclinical and clinical studies of therapeutics against viral infections.

N2  - Background: Essential health services are a package of services critical to improve health outcomes. COVID-19 pandemic disrupts essential health services. However, the level of essential health service disruption due to COVID-19 in Ethiopia is not clear. This study aimed at measuring the status of delivery of essential health services in Ethiopia during COVID-19. Methods: A national mixed-methods cross-sectional survey was conducted. It was undertaken in Amhara (10 districts), Oromia (eight districts), Sidama (six districts), Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (16 districts), and Dire Dawa City Administration. A total of 452 health facilities were surveyed. Data were collected using face-to-face interview. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically. Results: The woredas (districts) and health facilities which adopted essential health services before the COVID-19 pandemic were 81.4% and 51.2%, respectively. Nearly all health centers provided antenatal care services. Blood pressure measuring apparatus and delivery set were available in all health centers. However, only 50% of health centers had radiant warmer. Malnutrition services were provided by 47% of rural health centers. Moreover, a functional incinerator was available in only 41% of health centers. The provision of cardiovascular disease management was at 27.2%. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS treatment was provided by 43.5% of health facilities. Conclusion: The adoption of lists of essential health services was optimal. The status of delivery of essential health services was high for maternal healthcare. Neonatal care at birth, malnutrition treatment, and cardiovascular disease management were low. The district health system should strive more to maintain essential health services.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is the most precious time in every woman’s life. Pregnant women were facing an unprecedented situation in the COVID era, where going to hospitals for routine antenatal checkups had become worrisome as most of the hospitals were inundated with COVID-19-infected patients. Also, mothers who are infected with COVID-19 are more prone to give birth to preterm babies and are also at higher risk for other poor pregnancy outcomes. So, assessing the worry and well-being becomes utmost important. Hence, this study is planned to assess the worry and well-being among pregnant women. Materials and methods: About 359 pregnant women who attended PMSMA camps at four primary health centers (PHC) were interviewed using worry and well-being scales. Results: The prevalence of worry among the pregnant women was 50.97%. Variables such as Muslim religion (OR = 2.9), pregnancy-related complications (OR = 1.8), abortion history (OR = 2.5), vaccinated with two doses of Covishield (OR = 2.8), and worried about getting infected with COVID-19 (OR = 2.3) were the predictors/risk factors of worry among pregnant women. Muslim religion (OR = 1.8), history of abortion (OR = 2.1), vaccinated with two doses of Covishield (OR = 2.4) and being worried of getting infected with COVID-19 (OR = 2.3) were the predictors of low well-being among pregnant women. Conclusion: A significant percentage of pregnant women attending PHC for ANC checkups were suffering from worry and lower-level well-being. Queries concerning the pregnancy and COVID-19 should be addressed. Counseling should be given to high-risk pregnant women who have pre-existing comorbidities.

N2  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has ravaged the world since December 2019. Up to now, it is still prevalent around the world. Vaccines are an important means to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce severe disease and mortality. Currently, different types of novel coronavirus vaccines are still being developed and improved, and the relevant vaccines that have been approved for marketing have been widely vaccinated around the world. As vaccination coverage continues to grow, concerns about the efficacy and safety of vaccines after real-world use have grown. Some clinical studies have shown that vaccine effectiveness is closely related to antibody response after vaccination. Among them, the advantages of COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine, such as better adaptability to variant strains and better immune response ability, have attracted great attention. However, different populations with different genders, ages, previous COVID-19 infection history, underlying diseases and treatments will show different antibody responses after mRNA vaccination, which will affect the protection of the vaccine. Based on this, this paper reviews the reports related severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 mRNA vaccines, and summarizes the effectiveness of vaccines in different populations and different disease states and looked forward to the precise vaccination strategy of the vaccine in the future.

N2  - Introduction Risk factors for postpartum depression include a lack of social support and perceived social isolation. We would like to determine whether the isolation of inpatients on the maternity wards during Covid-19 leads to increased psychological stress. Methods This is a multicentre, controlled study of obstetric patients who gave birth during an inpatient stay. Patients were included during the visitation ban (study group) and after the visitation ban (control group). Psychological stress was evaluated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during the inpatient stay and six to eight weeks postpartum. Results A total of 194 women were included, 107 in the study group and 87 in the control group. The overall result of the first EPDS shows a higher score in the study group compared to the control group (7.0 vs. 4.9 points). Primipara show a higher score in the first EPDS compared to multipara (7.28 vs. 4.82). Caesarean section, regardless of isolation, shows a higher score in the first EPDS than vaginal birth (8.42 vs. 5.11). Comparison of vaginal birth shows a higher score only in the study group (5.97 vs. 4.07). Conclusion In the context of Covid-19, women giving birth and new mothers, especially primipara, are exposed to increased psychological stress in the clinics. Caesarean section leads to increased psychological stress.

N2  - Objective Long-term effects on infants of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy are increasingly discussed in the literature. Besides potential neurodevelopment impairments after intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 exposure, there might be differences in the postnatal pediatric care of those children, like the timing of preventive medical examinations (PME) or vaccinations. In this first national long-term follow-up study of women included in the CRONOS registry, we describe maternal impressions of their child's development and the prevalence of regulatory disorders, and we analyze the timing of PMEs and vaccinations. Methods 773 women who were enrolled between April 3, 2020, and August 24, 2021, in the CRONOS registry were eligible to be contacted by the study coordinators and asked to fill out a web-based questionnaire. Results 110/773 (14%) women completed the questionnaire. Their children were between the ages of 12 and 31 months (median 20 months). All mothers were satisfied with their child's development, milestones were achieved in a timely fashion. The reported prevalence for excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding disorders was 11%, 18-32%, and 7%, respectively. PMEs were mostly not delayed, but only 54% of infants received their first vaccination within their first 60 days of life. Discussion In summary, our exploratory findings suggest that developmental milestones in infancy are reached in time after maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, there are effects on the implementation of PMEs and vaccinations.

N2  - Purpose: To report historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures, to identify factors that may influence future spending, and to predict growth in drug spending in 2023 in the United States, with a focus on the nonfederal hospital and clinic sectors. Methods: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2023 were reviewed, including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, diabetes medications, generics, COVID-19 pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2023 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. Results: In 2022, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the US grew 9.4% compared to 2021, for a total of $633.5 billion. Utilization (a 5.9% increase), price (a 1.7% increase) and new drugs (a 1.8% increase) drove this increase. Adalimumab was the top-selling drug in 2022, followed by semaglutide and apixaban. Drug expenditures were $37.2 billion (a 5.9% decrease) and $116.9 billion (a 10.4% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and clinics, respectively. In clinics, new products and increased utilization growth drove growth, with a small impact from price changes. In nonfederal hospitals, a drop in utilization led to a decrease in expenditures, with price changes and new drugs contributing to growth in spending. Several new drugs that will influence spending have been or are expected to be approved in 2023. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: For 2023, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 6.0% to 8.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 8.0% to 10.0% and 1.0% to 3.0%, respectively, compared to 2022. These national estimates of future pharmaceutical expenditure growth may not be representative of any particular health system because of the myriad of local factors that influence actual spending.

N2  - Background: Assessing the maternal mental health status during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is necessary to prevent the occurrence of severe mental disorders. Prenatal depression, anxiety and stress disorders are prominent in pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and highly associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore this study aimed to assess the level of depression, anxiety, and stress among HIV-positive pregnant women in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Amhara region referral hospitals from 17 October 2020 to 1 March 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 423 eligible women. A structured, pretested and interviewer-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the data. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was implemented to identify factors associated with women's depression, anxiety and stress. Statistical association was certain based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-values ≤0.05. Results: Prenatal depression, anxiety and stress among HIV-positive pregnant women were 37.6% (95% CI 33 to 42.3), 42.1 (95% CI 37.7 to 46.7) and 34.8% (95% CI 30.3 to 39.2), respectively. Having an HIV-negative sexual partner (AOR 1.91 [95% CI 1.16 to 3.15]) and being on antiretroviral therapy >1 year (AOR 2.18 [95% CI 1.41 to 3.36]) were found to be statistically significant with women's antenatal depression, while unplanned pregnancy (AOR 1.09 [95% CI 1.02 to 2.33]) and did not discuss with the sexual partner about HIV (AOR 3.21 [95% CI 2.12 to 7.07]) were the factors associated with prenatal anxiety. Conclusions: In this study, more than one in three HIV-positive pregnant women had depression and anxiety. Thus, implementing strategies to prevent unplanned pregnancy and advocating open discussion with sexual partners about HIV will play a large role in reducing pregnancy-related depression and anxiety.

N2  - Background: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the subsequent measures by the government were associated with a drastic disruption of the lives of nearly everyone. Vulnerable groups were particularly affected, including pregnant women and mothers in the postpartum period. Objective: The aim of the review was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women and mothers in the postpartum period based on stress, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Furthermore, risk and protective factors that contributed to the development or prevention of postpartum mental illnesses during the pandemic were identified. Methods: A literature search was conducted via PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and Ovid Medline from April to June 2021. Data on anxiety, depression, stress, and PTSD symptoms, as well as potential risk and protective factors were extracted. Results: A total of 19 relevant studies with 44,709 participants were included. Nearly all studies recorded an increase in anxiety, depression, stress, and PTSD symptoms during the pandemic. Financial, intrafamilial stressors and concern for the child were identified as risk factors for the development of postpartum mental illnesses during the pandemic. Satisfaction with the couple relationship was apparently protective against stress and depression symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were reduced, for example, by increased levels of physical activity as well as perceived social support. Conclusion: Future studies are recommended to further investigate the risk factors for the development of postpartum mental illnesses. In addition, prevention programs for medical personnel as well as aftercare and therapy programs for affected mothers should be developed in order to prevent severe progression.

N2  - The public authority responsible for health insurance, through the elaboration of normative acts at the beginning of the pandemic, considered the establishment of measures to support vulnerable people who are in isolation at home, as a result of measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, in view of the activity of community health care. Romania, compared to other states, tried to organize and protect the country’s population in the best possible way during the pandemic period-COVID-19, this having a major impact on society. The central public authority together with the public authority responsible for health insurance, as well as the National Committee for Special Emergency Situations ensured the monitoring of the situation of coronavirus infected patients and the impact on the population. Also, as a result of monitoring the situation, measures were taken regarding the state of emergency and at the same time measures were taken to organize and coordinate the health system throughout the country. With the outbreak of the epidemic, a number of dysfunctions in the ability to deal with such a medical tragedy have emerged at the level of all states., the fragile balance of the mentality of the population and with the major impact of this tragedy. In Romania, from the beginning of the pandemic, it was noticed that the medical system was outdated, but we were not the only country facing this situation, this happening in many other countries in the Western world, but in our country the situation seemed unusual. In this pandemic situation, experts, medical specialists failed to inform the population about this virus and its consequences, in terms of guiding and guiding the population to vaccination and immunization, as well as establishing restrictions and issuing clear and concise regulations.

N2  - Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and accounts for significant global morbidity and mortality. Relatively little is known about the epidemiology of CHD in Jordan or the manner in which CHD is identified. Methods: A retrospective medical record review was conducted for all neonates who had an abnormal echocardiogram performed at a tertiary referral hospital. All included neonates had echocardiography performed by the same pediatric cardiologist at the discretion of the treatment team. Descriptive statistics were used to describe CHD incidence, types of CHD identified, and mechanism of identification. Results: The incidence of congenital heart disease was 17.8 per 1,000 live births. This rose to 24.6 per 1,000 if patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants was included. The most common identified abnormalities were PDA, atrial septal defects, persistent pulmonary hypertension, septal hypertrophy, and ventricular septal defects. Most children were evaluated either for a murmur heard on exam or as a part of screening due to other comorbidities or risk factors. Less than 1% of children had a prenatal diagnosis. There was a higher rate of persistent pulmonary hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There is a high incidence of CHD in Jordan. Increased prenatal and perinatal screening for CHD may allow for earlier detection.

N2  - Introduction: The overdose crisis is increasingly revealing disparities in opioid use disorder (OUD) outcomes by race and ethnicity. Virginia, like other states, has witnessed drastic increases in overdose deaths. However, research has not described how the overdose crisis has impacted pregnant and postpartum Virginians. We report the prevalence of OUD-related hospital use during the first year postpartum among Virginia Medicaid members in the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. We secondarily assess how prenatal OUD treatment is associated with postpartum OUD-related hospital use. Methods: This population-level retrospective cohort study used Virginia Medicaid claims data for live infant deliveries between July 2016 and June 2019. The primary outcome of OUD-related hospital use included overdose events, emergency department visits, and acute inpatient stays. Independent variables of interest were prenatal receipt of medication for OUD (MOUD) and receipt of non-MOUD treatment components in line with a comprehensive care approach (e.g., case management, behavioral health). Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed for all deliveries and stratified by White and Black non-Hispanic individuals to bring attention to the devastating impacts of the overdose crisis within communities of color. Results: The study sample included 96,649 deliveries. Over a third were by Black birthing individuals (n = 34,283). Prenatally, 2.5 % had evidence of OUD, which occurred more often among White (4 %) than Black (0.8 %) non-Hispanic birthing individuals. Postpartum OUD-related hospital use occurred in 10.7 % of deliveries with OUD, more commonly after deliveries by Black, non-Hispanic birthing individuals with OUD (16.5 %) than their White, non-Hispanic counterparts (9.7 %), and this disparity persisted in the multivariable analysis (Black AOR 1.64, 95 % CI 1.14–2.36). Postpartum OUD-related hospital events were less frequent for individuals receiving versus not receiving postpartum MOUD within 30 days prior to the event. Prenatal OUD treatment, including MOUD, was not associated with decreased odds of postpartum OUD-related hospital use in the race-stratified models. Conclusion: Postpartum individuals with OUD are at high risk for mortality and morbidity, especially Black individuals not receiving MOUD after delivery. An urgent need remains to effectively address the systemic and structural drivers of racial disparities in transitions of OUD care through the one-year postpartum period.

N2  - STUDY QUESTION: What are fertility staff experiences of managing COVID-19-related uncertainty after fertility clinics re-opened? SUMMARY ANSWER: Staff identified many COVID-19-related uncertainty sources, the main being the COVID-19 health threat, to which most clinics and staff responded effectively by implementing safety protocols and building strong collaborative environments that facilitated the acquisition and application of information to guide organizational responses during a rapidly changing situation, but with costs for staff and patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: COVID-19 created significant disruption in fertility care delivery, including temporary clinic closure and treatment delay. Patients experienced significant distress, including concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 and its vaccine on fertility and pregnancy. Multiple studies show that COVID-19-related uncertainty is a major threat and burden for healthcare staff, but this has not been investigated in reproductive medicine. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A cross-sectional, online mixed-method bilingual (English, Spanish) survey (active 25 January-23 May 2021) was distributed to fertility staff across the UK, Latin America, and Africa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Eligibility criteria were being a healthcare worker at a fertility clinic that had re-opened since its COVID-19-related closure, 18 years of age or older and ability to respond in English or Spanish. The survey was created in English, translated to Spanish, made available using Qualtrics, and consisted of four parts: (i) background and physical and mental wellbeing, (ii) open-ended questions regarding COVID-19 uncertainty, (iii) appraisal items regarding perceptions and impact of uncertainty, and (iv) changes in the workplace. The British Fertility Society and the African Network and Registry of Assisted Reproduction circulated the survey across the UK and Africa via email hyperlinks and social media platforms. The Argentinian Society of Reproductive Medicine and the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction distributed the survey across Latin America in the same manner. Thematic analysis was performed on responses from open-ended question to produce basic codes. Deductive coding grouped sub-Themes across questions into themes related to the theory of uncertainty management. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of variance were used on the quantitative data. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 382 staff consented to the survey, 107 did not complete (28% attrition), and 275 completed. Sixty-Three percent were women, 69% were physicians, and 79% worked at private clinics. Thematic analysis produced 727 codes, organized in 92 sub-Themes, and abstracted into 18 themes and one meta-Theme reflecting that uncertainty is stressful but manageable. The types of uncertainties related to the threat of COVID-19 (20.6%), unpredictability of the future (19.5%), failure of communication (11.4%), and change in the workplace (8.4%). Staff appraisals of negative and positive impact of uncertainty were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than appraisals of stress, controllability, and having what it takes to cope with uncertainty. To process uncertainty, clinics focused on information dissemination (30.8%) and building a collaborative work environment (5.8%), while staff employed proactive coping (41.8%) and emotional and cognitive processing (9.6%). Main organizational responses consisted on work restructuring (41.3%, e.g. safety protocols), adapting to adversity (9.5%, e.g. supplies, preparation), and welfare support (13.8%), though staff perceived lack of support (17.5%). Negative consequences of uncertainty were worse self-And patient welfare (12.1%) and worse communication due to virtual medicine and use of mask (9.6%). Positive consequences were work improvements (8.3%), organizational adaptation (8.3%), improved relationships (5.6%), and individual adaptation (3.2%). Ninety-Two percent of participants thought changes experienced in the workplace due to COVID-19 were negative, 9.1% nor negative nor positive, and 14.9% positive. Most staff thought that their physical (92.4%) and mental health (89.5%) were good to excellent. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Participants were self-selected, and most were physicians and embryologists working at private clinics based in Latin America. The study did not account for how variability in national and regional COVID-19 policy shaped staff experiences of uncertainty. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: To address COVID-19 uncertainty, clinics need to promote collaborative (clinic, staff, patients) processing of uncertainty, clear team coordination and communication, organizational flexibility, and provision of support to staff and patients, with an emphasis on cognitive coping to decrease threat of and increase tolerance to uncertainty. Uncertainty management interventions bespoke to fertility care that integrate these components may increase clinics resilience to COVID-19-related and other types of uncertainty.

N2  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have become the second in the global rating of infectious diseases after respiratory infections. Globally, over 1 million, new STI is diagnosed every day. Although four conditions are the most representative and of obligatory declaration (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), there are many other prevalent STI, including trichomona, herpes simplex, papillomavirus, and viral hepatitis. Herein, we perform a narrative and retrospective review, analyzing information from public databases from distinct Spanish government institutions. STI significantly declined in Spain during 2020 as a result of lockdown and social isolation measures dictated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After releasing restrictions, a major STI rebound occurred in 2021. Increases were 49% for gonorrhea, 45% for HIV, 39% for chlamydia, and 32% for syphilis. Based on nationwide statistics, we build a narrative review of the recent STI surge after COVID-19. In summary, we propose a holistic approach to confront the current re-emergence of STI. On one hand, new innovative medical advances must be implemented, including new rapid tests, novel vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis beyond HIV, and long-acting antivirals. On the other hand, information to citizens needs to be reformulated with interventions aimed to build a healthier society, alike it has been undertaken with tobacco, alcohol, diet, and lifestyle. STI determines important sexual, reproductive, and maternal-child health consequences. To promote human well-being or flourishing, the education of adolescents and young adults should be aligned with human ecology. Therefore, it is urgent to address new approaches in sexual health that represent a clear benefit for individual persons and society. In this way, favoring a cultural evolution aimed to delay the age of first sexual intercourse and the avoidance of multiple sex partners should be prioritized.

N2  - The Government of Kenya initiated COVID-19 vaccination program in March 2021. However, vaccine uptake remains low, especially in rural areas in Kenya. We interviewed 40 residents of Eldoret town to explore the knowledge, beliefs, and meanings they attach towards vaccines generally, and why they chose to vaccinate or not. Two-thirds of our participants perceived themselves to be at risk of COVID-19 infections. About half demonstrated willingness to be vaccinated and about a third had been vaccinated. All participants were knowledgeable about the broader benefits of vaccination. Yet, widespread beliefs that vaccination programmes target children and pregnant women decreased vaccine acceptance. Also, we found that concerns about vaccine safety, lack of knowledge, misinformation from social media, and conspiracy theories contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Eldoret. Low COVID-19 vaccination rates and hesitancy–even when the vaccines are accessible and free in Kenya–cannot be ignored. The current COVID-19 vaccination prioritisation schedule (distinct from the usual structure where children, childbearing women are prioritised) and beliefs that older people are targeted to test vaccines efficacy must be addressed through improved communication and mass education. More research is needed to investigate the socio-economic, political, and historical factors that influence vaccine hesitancy in Kenya.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe worldwide health concerns since its first description as the SARS-COV-2 virus in December 2019. The wide dissemination of this virus, together with the lack of treatment, prompted vaccine development within a short period of time to elicit a protective immunity against COVID-19. Due to their rapid development, potential subsequent side effects of COVID-19 vaccines were overlooked, which might lead to many health concerns. This is especially true for patients at a greater risk of harm from COVID-19, such as pregnant women, children, and patients with pre-existing chronic diseases. In this review, we provide a summary of common to rare side effects of administrated COVID-19 vaccines in a Middle Eastern population. We have found that the distinction between side effects from COVID-19 vaccines in terms of frequency and severity is attributed to the differences in study populations, gender, and age. Pain at the injection site, fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were the most common reported side effects. Vaccinated subjects with previous COVID-19 infection exhibited an equivalent neutralizing response after just one dose compared to two doses of vaccine. Consequently, individuals who experienced more side effects had significantly higher antibody levels. This indicates that having better immunity correlates with higher antibody levels, leading to a higher frequency of vaccine side effects. Individuals with underlying comorbidities, particularly having known allergies and with illnesses such as diabetes and cancer, might be more prone to post-vaccination side effects. Studies of a high-risk population in Middle Eastern countries are limited. Future studies should be considered to determine long-term side effects, side effects after booster doses, and side effect differences in cases of heterologous and homologous vaccination for better understanding and proper handling of high-risk populations and patients who experience these side effects.

N2  - Objective: To assess the impact of Covid-19 on healthcare provision, to investigate how the surgical teams adapted to this challenge and to identify ways in which we could enhance the quality of care provided to the patients in case we come across such challenges again in future. Methodology: This cross-sectional study gathered data from three major tertiary care hospitals. A questionnaire having three sections was administered to record the general characteristics of the surgical setups and subsequent changes due to Covid-19 infection, the extent of provision of PPEs and their adherence and the impact of Covid-19 on the surgical setups. Results: A total of 46 different surgical departments were assessed. General surgery was contributor at 19.6%, followed by gynecology/obstetrics, trauma and orthopedics, and urology, each contributing 10.9%. More than half (52.2) setups reported that they had to convert their ward to covid ward. Shortage of staff, along with adverse effects on residents’ training and suboptimal use of telemedicine was also found. Conclusion: With elective procedures halted, the backlog of surgeries significantly increased, and the education of residents and students was adversely affected. With adequate use of telemedicine, surgical services can be dispensed to some extent. Alternative ways to replace interactive surgical learning should be searched for.

N2  - The endothelium is a biologically active interface with multiple functions, some of them common throughout the vascular tree, and others that depend on its anatomical location. Endothelial cells are continually exposed to cellular and humoral factors, and to all those elements (biological, chemical, or hemodynamic) that circulate in blood at a certain time. It can adapt to different stimuli but this capability may be lost if the stimuli are strong enough and/or persistent in time. If the endothelium loses its adaptability it may become dysfunctional, becoming a potential real danger to the host. Endothelial dysfunction is present in multiple clinical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, major depression, pregnancy-related complications, septic syndromes, COVID-19, and thrombotic microangiopathies, among other pathologies, but also in association with cell therapies, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T cells. In these diverse conditions, evidence suggests that the presence and severity of endothelial dysfunction correlate with the severity of the associated disease. More importantly, endothelial dysfunction has a strong diagnostic and prognostic value for the development of critical complications that, although may differ according to the underlying disease, have a vascular background in common. Our multidisciplinary team of women has devoted many years to exploring the role of the endothelium in association with the mentioned diseases and conditions. Our research group has characterized some of the mechanisms and also proposed biomarkers of endothelial damage. A better knowledge would provide therapeutic strategies either to prevent or to treat endothelial dysfunction.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reached an entirely new level of severity. It has jolted the entire world and caused pervasive chaos. A significant portion of the psychological responses thus far have been reactions to events in other countries, worries about the future, and responses to con-finement. Initial and prominent responses to the pandemic in India have been appalling, with a sense of impending and palpable danger. Concerns based on facts coexist with those based on the abun-dance of information and misinformation disseminated by the media, particularly social media. Even with the stringent requirements for testing, many individuals still seek reassurance through testing. Despite the lack of general indications for their use, they stockpile pharmaceuticals out of dread of contracting the disease. In addition to recommendations regarding hand cleansing, there are uncer-tainties regarding whether to wear a mask, the type of mask to use, the distance to be maintained, and how to disinfect surfaces. There are legitimate concerns regarding employment losses and economic decline during and after the pandemic. Social isolation and social prejudice are not synonymous. Maintaining a distance of 1-2 meters is permissible for security purposes. In terms of status and op-portunities, everyone should be treated equally. The situation calls for a cheerful tone of speech. Using expressions such as "the end of the world" and "the plague" is discouraged. Contamination caused by rumors must be avoided. It is essential to promote early detection and prevention. Those who have been afflicted with COVID-19 must share their accounts of compassion and struggle. Be-fore COVID-19, only a minority of individuals with mental health issues were treated. According to studies, the pandemic has widened the mental health treatment divide, and outpatient mental health services have been particularly disrupted.

N2  - Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection worldwide causing severe morbidity in newborns, infants, and children. Despite the clinical importance of congenital CMV (cCMV) infection, studies conducted so far indicate that there is limited awareness in the medical community in the field. The aim of this study was to assess Greek medical students’ knowledge on cCMV infection. Methods: We performed a questionnaire-based nationwide cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of medical students from seven medical schools was enrolled. Results: Of the 562 respondents, 54,8% considered themselves undereducated on cCMV infection. However, almost half of the participants could correctly recognize some basic principles of cCMV infection including ways of transmission, diagnosis and treatment, while there were aspects of cCMV infection with knowledge deficit. The year of study had a positive impact on the level of knowledge with students of higher years of study being of more sufficient education on the specific topic. Conclusion: Overall, our study indicates a discrepancy between self-reported awareness and the level of knowledge among medical students in Greece. Further educational opportunities about cCMV should be offered, particularly in areas of the curriculum involving the care of women and children. Establishing medical students’ solid background on the disease burden and educating them about preventative strategies for at-risk populations, should be the main pillars of such efforts in order to promote confidence in managing these cases in their future professional careers.

N2  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is classified under postpartum psychiatric disorders and initiates soon after birthing, eliciting neuropsychological and behavioral deficits in mothers and offspring. Globally, PPD is estimated to be associated with 130–190 per 1000 birthing. The severity and incidences of PPD have aggravated in the recent years due to the several unfavorable environmental and geopolitical circumstances. The purpose of this systematic review hence is to explore the contributions of recent circumstances on the pathogenesis and incidence of PPD. The search, selection and retrieval of the articles published during the last three years were systematically performed. The results from the primary studies indicate that unfavorable contemporary socio-geopolitical and environmental circumstances (e.g. Covid-19 pandemic, political conflicts/wars, and natural calamities; such as floods and earthquakes) detrimentally affect PPD etiology. A combination of socio-economic and psychological factors, including perceived lack of support and anxiousness about the future may contribute to drastic aggravation of PPD incidences. Finally, we outline some of the potential treatment regimens (e.g. inter-personal psycho- and art-based therapies) that may prove to be effective in amelioration of PPD-linked symptoms in birthing women, either alone or in complementation with traditional pharmacological interventions. We propose these psychological and art-based intervention strategies may beneficially counteract the negative influences of the unfortunate recent events across multiple cultures, societies and geographical regions.

N2  - Introduction: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has provided crucial tools for pandemic control, but the occurrence of vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) underscores the need for comprehensive monitoring. Methods: This study analyzed the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data from 2020–2022 using statistical methods such as zero-truncated Poisson regression and logistic regression to assess associations with age, gender groups, and vaccine manufacturers. Results: Logistic regression identified 26 System Organ Classes (SOCs) significantly associated with age and gender. Females displayed especially higher odds in SOC 19 (Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions), while males had higher odds in SOC 25 (Surgical and medical procedures). Older adults (>65) were more prone to symptoms like Cardiac disorders, whereas those aged 18–65 showed susceptibility to AEs like Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Moderna and Pfizer vaccines induced fewer SOC symptoms compared to Janssen and Novavax. The zero-truncated Poisson regression model estimated an average of 4.243 symptoms per individual. Conclusion: These findings offer vital insights into vaccine safety, guiding evidence-based vaccination strategies and monitoring programs for precise and effective outcomes.

N2  - Background: Anxiety in the peripartum period (pregnancy through one-year postpartum) has negative impacts on mothers and infants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high rates of anxiety were reported worldwide, but trajectories for how these symptoms change longitudinally in the peripartum period remain unknown. Methods: A total of 1,411 women who were pregnant during the second U.S. COVID-19 surge completed four study questionnaires between December 2020 and March 2022, including assessments of anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) and individual and community-level contributors. Latent Class Growth Mixture Models (LCGMM) were used to identify anxiety trajectories, and multinomial logistic regression was used to identify contributors to class membership. Results: Three classes of anxiety symptom trajectories were identified. Class 1 (n = 956, 67.8%) experienced minimal/mild anxiety throughout the peripartum period. Class 2 (n = 362, 25.7%) experienced initial moderate anxiety that remained stable. Class 3 (n = 93, 6.6%) experienced initial moderate anxiety that increased to severe in the postpartum period. Stress and history of mental health diagnosis contributed to higher initial levels of anxiety and ongoing social support contributed to lower levels of anxiety. In addition, financial insecurity increased the risk of belonging to Class 3. Conclusions: Screening for anxiety symptoms and psychosocial vulnerabilities in the peripartum period is vital, as is early intervention. This is especially the case among women with limited financial and social resources who may experience chronic or worsening anxiety as they transition to parenthood.

N2  - Introduction: Loneliness has been shown to affect both mental and physical health, and was a major concern even before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 distancing measures, millions of people took to social media to express their feelings and seek social support. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, we examine the self-disclosure of loneliness by users identifying as male or female (via self-disclosed naming conventions) on Twitter before and during the COVID-19 “lockdowns.” Results: We show that in the first two months of COVID-19 restrictions, self-disclosure of loneliness on this platform rose dramatically, and also have changed qualitatively. We find that female accounts tend to post more loneliness self-disclosures compared to male ones, even before COVID. Female disclosures more often center around pregnancy, family, and close relationships, whereas those posted by the male ones are more related to leadership, video gaming and sex. During COVID lockdowns, female accounts turn to online messaging apps and hobbies, and male become increasingly vocal in seeking partners. Discussion: The insights of this study have important implications for the design of interventions for lessening the burden of loneliness in the current digitized world.

N2  - Background: Vaccination serves as an efficient primary means of control for infectious diseases. However, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women within the United States had the lowest rates of COVID-19 vaccination and reported the lowest intent to vaccinate. Objectives: To explore the decision-making process for COVID-19 vaccination for people pregnant during the pandemic. Design: A secondary analysis of data from a mixed-methods study that examined the impact of COVID-19 on experiences of prenatal care, birth support, and delivery in the Southern United States. Methods: This study used a descriptive phenomenological approach to thematically analyze in-depth interviews (n = 20) with adult women who were pregnant by January 2020 and had their prenatal care and delivery during the pandemic beginning in March 2020. The transcripts were de-identified, coded, and thematically analyzed to saturation to identify drivers of COVID-19 vaccine decision-making based on COVID-19 vaccination status and timing. Comparative analyses were conducted to assess differences in decision-making processes based on race/ethnicity and parity. Participants also completed a sociodemographic survey that included their COVID-19 vaccination status. Results: Two themes emerged, the weighing of parallel risks and priorities from different sources resulting in vaccine decisional conflict and the need to reconcile that conflict via multiple strategies. All participants weighed priorities and risks from multiple areas of their lives and described internal conflict around vaccination. Participants described tailoring decisions to household dynamics, reconciling public and private values around vaccination, and the impact of their identities on the decision-making process. While many described concerns over vaccine safety and fetal health, uniquely, many highlighted weighing the impact of prior pregnancy loss history, with some choosing other preventive measures like social distancing or mask-wearing, which they deemed less risky. Conclusion: Pregnant people make complex COVID-19 vaccination decisions, which must be considered in future vaccine messaging and advocacy for this group.

N2  - Background: Vital signs measurements on the ward are performed intermittently. This could lead to failure to rapidly detect patients with deteriorating vital signs and worsens long-term outcome. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that continuous wireless monitoring of vital signs on the postsurgical ward improves patient outcome. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, stepped-wedge cluster randomized study, patients in the control group received standard monitoring. The intervention group received continuous wireless monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature on top of standard care. Automated alerts indicating vital signs deviation from baseline were sent to ward nurses, triggering the calculation of a full early warning score followed. The primary outcome was the occurrence of new disability three months after surgery. Results: The study was terminated early (at 57% inclusion) due to COVID-19 restrictions. Therefore, only descriptive statistics are presented. A total of 747 patients were enrolled in this study and eligible for statistical analyses, 517 patients in the control group and 230 patients in the intervention group, the latter only from one hospital. New disability at three months after surgery occurred in 43.7% in the control group and in 39.1% in the intervention group (absolute difference 4.6%). Conclusion: This is the largest randomized controlled trial investigating continuous wireless monitoring in postoperative patients. While patients in the intervention group seemed to experience less (new) disability than patients in the control group, results remain inconclusive with regard to postoperative patient outcome due to premature study termination. Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02957825.

N2  - Introduction: Racism, a known social determinant of health, affects the mental health and well-being of pregnant and postpartum women and their children. Convincing evidence highlights the urgent need to better identify the mechanisms and the ways in which young children’s development and mental health are adversely impacted by their mothers’ experiences of racism. With the additional stressor of the COVID-19 pandemic, the criticality of improving knowledge of these domains has never been starker. The proposed project will address these questions and move the field forward to create targeted, culturally informed preventative interventions, thus achieving mental health equity for all children and families. Methods: This prospective research is a cohort study that will longitudinally observe the outcomes of a cohort of mothers and their children recruited during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data will be parent/caregiver questionnaires assessing mental health, racism, support, and resilience at multiple time points with the first beginning at 24 months, clinical interviews with mothers, electronic medical records of mothers, and videotaped dyadic interactions at child age 24 and 48 months. A subset of Black participants will be asked to participate in qualitative interviews at child age 36 months. Results: Analyze will be performed within and across Black and Non-Latino/a/e/x white (NLW) groups, and comparing mothers and fathers/secondary caregivers. Descriptive and multivariate analyzes will be run to better characterize how young children’s development and mental health may be adversely impacted by their caregiver’s experiences of racism. Discussion: This prospective longitudinal mixed-methods study evaluates the simultaneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and racism on mothers and their developing children to characterize cross-racial differences, providing insight into risk and resilience factors in early development and the peripartum period.

N2  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an underreported public health crisis primarily affecting women associated with severe health conditions and can lead to a high rate of homicide. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, more women with IPV experiences visited online health communities (OHCs) to seek help because of anonymity. However, little is known regarding whether their help requests were answered and whether the information provided was delivered in an appropriate manner. To understand the help-seeking information sought and given in OHCs, extraction of postings and linguistic features could be helpful to develop automated models to improve future help-seeking experiences. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the types and patterns (ie, communication styles) of the advice offered by OHC members and whether the information received from women matched their expressed needs in their initial postings. Methods: We examined data from Reddit using data from subreddit community r/domesticviolence posts from November 14, 2020, through November 14, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We included posts from women aged ≥18 years who self-identified or described experiencing IPV and requested advice or help in this subreddit community. Posts from nonabused women and women aged <18 years, non-English posts, good news announcements, gratitude posts without any advice seeking, and posts related to advertisements were excluded. We developed a codebook and annotated the postings in an iterative manner. Initial posts were also quantified using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to categorize linguistic and posting features. Postings were then classified into 2 categories (ie, matched needs and unmatched needs) according to the types of help sought and received in OHCs to capture the help-seeking result. Nonparametric statistical analysis (ie, 2-tailed t test or Mann-Whitney U test) was used to compare the linguistic and posting features between matched and unmatched needs. Results: Overall, 250 postings were included, and 200 (80%) posting response comments matched with the type of help requested in initial postings, with legal advice and IPV knowledge achieving the highest matching rate. Overall, 17 linguistic or posting features were found to be significantly different between the 2 groups (ie, matched help and unmatched help). Positive title sentiment and linguistic features in postings containing health and wellness wordings were associated with unmatched needs postings, whereas the other 14 features were associated with postings with matched needs. Conclusions: OHCs can extract the linguistic and posting features to understand the help-seeking result among women with IPV experiences. Features identified in this corpus reflected the differences found between the 2 groups. This is the first study that leveraged Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to shed light on generating predictive features from unstructured text in OHCs, which could guide future algorithm development to detect help-seeking results within OHCs effectively.

N2  - Introduction: Wisconsin experienced overlapping and accelerating epidemics of opioid use and COVID-19 after March 2020. We hypothesized that Wisconsin neonatal abstinence syndrome rates increased after March 2020 alongside other markers of opioid burden. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis examined deidentified Wisconsin census, birth certificate, death certificate, hospital discharge, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, emergency medical service run, and COVID-19 diagnosis records spanning January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021. January 2019 through March 2020 was considered before the onset of COVID-19 (pre); April 2020 through December 2021 was considered post-onset of COVID-19 (post). Wisconsin Department of Health Services guidelines defined 5 Wisconsin regions. Rates pre-to post-onset were compared with P values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: From January 2019 through December 2021, 190 072 infants were born in Wisconsin, of which 1205 were diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Statewide opioid-associated deaths, emergency medical service runs, and emergency department visits all increased from the pre-to post-onset periods. Per-person Prescription Drug Monitoring Program rates decreased in both the total population and childbearing-age females (15-44 years), and statewide deaths in childbearing-age females increased significantly (P < 0.001). Statewide monthly neonatal abstinence syndrome incidence rates did not change significantly (6.68/1000 births to 6.10/1000 births; P = 0.16) but decreased significantly in the most populous Southeastern Region (8.13/1000 births to 6.37/1000 births; P = 0.02) of the state. Conclusions: Opioid-associated morbidity and mortality increased in Wisconsin during the study period, including among females age 15 to 44 years. Despite increased opioid burden, neonatal abstinence syndrome incidence decreased in the Southeastern Region. Ongoing neonatal abstinence syndrome and opioid analysis may benefit from region-based contextualization.

N2  - Background. Pregnant women were indirectly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic owing to heightened stress, fear of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 and the disruption of antenatal health services. Increased stress and lack of antenatal healthcare could result in an increase in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth or low birthweight. Objectives. Using a case-control design, to compare the prevalence of low birthweight among infants born before and during the pandemic in Soweto, South Africa. Method. Infants born before the pandemic and national lockdown were included in the control group, while infants who were in utero and born during the pandemic were included in the case group. Only infants born ≥37 weeks’ gestation with no birth complications were included. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine whether the pandemic was associated with an increase in low birthweight. A birthweight <2.5 kg was classified as low birthweight. Results. In total, 199 mother-infant pairs were included in the control group, with 201 mother-infant pairs in the case group. The prevalence of low birthweight was 4% in the control group and 11% in the case group, with those born during the pandemic at a higher risk of being of low birthweight. Conclusion. The high prevalence of low birthweight in infants born ≥37 weeks’ gestation during the pandemic could result in an increase in child stunting and poor development. Future research should measure early child development and growth in infants born during the pandemic to assess whether there is a need to intervene and provide additional support to minimise the negative effects.

N2  - Objective: The objective is to investigate whether is there any differences in the mental health of pregnant women during Delta and Omicron COVID-19 waves and to determine the variables related to the symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety of pregnant women. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2021 (Delta wave) and March to June 2022 (Omicron wave). Pregnant women were evaluated using a questionnaire consisting of sections assessing sociodemographic characteristics, the perceived burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and psychometric instruments: depression anxiety and stress scales-21 (DASS-21), and perception of causes of COVID-19 scale. Results: DASS anxiety, depression, and stress subscales scores were higher in the Delta wave than in the Omicron wave (p<0.001). Mothers’ anxiety and fears about their own health and the health of their babies were higher in the Delta wave than in the Omicron wave (p<0.001). DASS symptoms were found to be associated with education level, employment, income, and weight gain during pregnancy (all p<0.05). Conclusion: This study indicated that stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were higher in pregnant women in the Delta wave than in the Omicron wave. This study recommended the implementation of mental health promotion, prevention, and intervention strategies to support pregnant women during epidemics.

N2  - Introduction: Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, parents were expected to understand increasingly sophisticated information about health issues and healthcare systems and access online resources as a part of their caregiving role. Yet little is known about parents' online digital technology use and digital health literacy skill. This study aimed to investigate parents' digital technology use, their self-reported digital health literacy skill, and demographic information as potential factors influencing their use of digital technologies. Methods: An online survey utilizing convenience sampling was administered to new parents during the COVID-19 pandemic that inquired about their demographic information, digital technology use, and digital health literacy skills within Ontario, Canada. Results: A total of 151 individuals responded to the survey; these were primarily mothers (80%) who self-reported as white (72%), well-educated 86%), heterosexual (86%) females (85%) with incomes over $100,00 per year (48%). Participants reported consistent and persistent online activity related to their parenting role and mostly via mobile smartphone devices (92%). Participants had moderate to high digital health literacy skills, greater than the Canadian national average. Almost half of participants reported negative health and well-being consequences from their digital online behaviours. There were no significant relationships between technology use, digital health literacy skill, and demographic variables. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for and importance of effective and equitable digital health services. Important opportunities exist within clinical practice and among parenting groups to proactively address the physical and mental health implications of digital parenting practices. Equally important are opportunities to insert into clinical workflow the inquiry into parents' online information-seeking behaviours, and to include digital health literacy as part of prenatal/postnatal health education initiatives.

N2  - bacKGrOUnd: the rapid development of the cOvid-19 pandemic has altered the context of healthcare around the world. sars-cov-2 positive pregnant and postnatal women, being at greater risk of complications, require continuous midwifery surveillance as well as specialized medical care. Scientific literature lacks studies related to midwifery care models in hospital settings during the pandemic. the aim of this work is to describe hospitalizations in an obstetric-gynecological cOvid care unit and to provide a descriptive analysis of the organizational and care model adopted. METHODS: A cohort retrospective descriptive study was carried out. The sample was stratified by COVID-related care complexity and by obstetric risk. the sample recruited pregnant women, postnatal women, and gynecological patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the obstetric-gynecological COVID unit of a birth center in Northern italy, from March 16, 2020, to March 16, 2022. resUlts: a number of 1037 women were hospitalized, and of these, 551 were sars-cov-2 positive women. the 551 sars-cov-2 positive women included 362 pregnant women, 132 postnatal women, 9 gynecological patients with medical diagnosis while 17 with a surgical path, and 31 women undergoing voluntary interruption of pregnancy. The final sample included 536 women. 68.6% of women requested a low care complexity, 22.8% a medium one, and 8.6% a high care complexity. among the obstetric women population, the majority (70.6%) showed a high obstetric risk. cOnclUsiOns: the cOvid-19 cohort of women required different levels of care with various care complexity and levels of obstetric risk. the model adopted allowed the acquisition of new technical and professional skills as well as the sharing of responsibilities and competences according to the care model of the buddy system. Future studies could investigate cOvid-related care models adopted internationally, but also deepen the technical and professional skills developed by midwives during the pandemic in order to enrich, improve and support midwifery profession.

N2  - Introduction: We implemented a large-scale remote patient monitoring (RPM) program for patients diagnosed with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) at a not-for-profit regional healthcare system. In this retrospective observational study, patients from nine emergency department (ED) sites were provided a pulse oximeter and enrolled onto a monitoring platform upon discharge. Methods: The RPM team captured oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, temperature, and symptom progression data over a 16-day monitoring period, and the team engaged patients via video call, phone call, and chat within the platform. Abnormal vital signs were flagged by the RPM team, with escalation to in-person care and return to ED as appropriate. Our primary outcome was to describe study characteristics: patients enrolled in the COVID-19 RPM program; engagement metrics; and physiologic and symptomatic data trends. Our secondary outcomes were return-to-ED rate and subsequent readmission rate. Results: Between December 2020-August 2021, a total of 3,457 patients were referred, and 1,779 successfully transmitted at least one point of data. Patients on COVID-19 RPM were associated with a lower 30-day return-to-ED rate (6.2%) than those not on RPM (14.9%), with capture of higher acuity patients (47.7% of RPM 30-day returnees were subsequently hospitalized vs 34.8% of non-RPM returnees). Conclusion: Our program, one of the largest studies to date that captures both physiologic and symptomatic data, may inform others who look to implement a program of similar scope. We also share lessons learned regarding barriers and disparities in enrollment and discuss implications for RPM in other acute disease states. [West J Emerg Med. 2023;24(6)1085-1093.].

N2  - In Japan, the increasing trend of delayed marriage and inclusion of infertility treatments into insurance coverage have led to a significant need to develop comprehensive treatment plans which incorporate dental interventions commencing prior to the initiation of infertility treatments. This study is aimed to highlight a holistic approach taking into account the various stages of pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare, and the evolving health status of patients while planning infertility treatment procedures, by establishing an effective interdisciplinary collaboration between medical and dental practitioners. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because in the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals undergoing fertility treatments, pregnant and lactating women exhibit a notable propensity for heightened anxieties, including substantial concerns regarding oral health-related problems and dental procedures, which need to be addressed thoroughly. Further, we believe that this paper will be of interest to the readership of your journal because our study findings will benefit the patients and doctors alike in devising effective treatment protocols for successful outcomes.

N2  - Pseudocyesis is a complex psychiatric manifestation of the physical symptoms of pregnancy. Although not pregnant, the pseudocyetic patient displays signs and symptoms consistent with pregnancy, such as abdominal distention, cramping, and/or sensations of fetal movement. Pseudocyesis is more common in developing countries than in the developed world, possibly due to the importance that traditional societies attach to childbearing and the low social status that these societies assign to women who are unable to produce children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged women in developed countries may also be at increased risk. Although the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of pseudocyesis are poorly understood, it manifests with real symptoms, which may complicate both the patient’s perspective about her condition and the medical and psychiatric teams’ approach to the patient. This case report is one of only a few in the literature to present an example of pseudocyesis developing in the context of acute mania. After describing the patient’s clinical course, from her initial symptoms of pseudocyesis to their eventual resolution, this report will provide recommendations for the sensitive care of patients with this rare but significant condition.

N2  - Objective: To explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected fetal care, social support, and emotional functioning for women carrying a fetus with CHD. Method: This was a single-centre qualitative study of 31 women who received a prenatal diagnosis of CHD during the pandemic. Patients completed semi-structured interviews about their experiences with fetal care, social support, and perceptions of risk to themselves and their fetus. Consistent themes regarding the impact of the pandemic were identified using an inductive thematic approach. Demographic data were collected via self-report and chart review. Results: Women generally reported consistent access to fetal care throughout the pandemic, with frequent use of telemedicine in addition to in-person care, but negative impacts resulting from restrictions on family support at appointments. Limited access to social support overall and a loss of pregnancy traditions were described. Many women reported feeling isolated and experiencing worries and fears about COVID-19 but also noted feeling supported by their healthcare team. Partner/family support during appointments and connection to peer-to-peer support were identified as recommendations to mitigate negative impacts. Conclusion: Women carrying a fetus with CHD during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced unique stressors that may affect mental health. However, many also experienced unexpected supports that may mitigate effects of pandemic-related stressors. Results can inform efforts to promote positive family outcomes during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Oxford Precision Psychiatry Lab (OxPPL) developed open-access web-based summaries of mental health care guidelines (OxPPL guidance) in key areas such as digital approaches and telepsychiatry, suicide and self-harm, domestic violence and abuse, perinatal care, and vaccine hesitancy and prioritization in the context of mental illness, to inform timely clinical decision-making. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the practice of creating evidence-based health guidelines during health emergencies using the OxPPL guidance as an example. An international network of clinical sites and colleagues (in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) including clinicians, researchers, and experts by experience aimed to (1) evaluate the clinical impact of the OxPPL guidance, as an example of an evidence-based summary of guidelines; (2) review the literature for other evidence-based summaries of COVID-19 guidelines regarding mental health care; and (3) produce a framework for response to future global health emergencies. Methods: The impact and clinical utility of the OxPPL guidance were assessed using clinicians' feedback via an international survey and focus groups. A systematic review (protocol registered on Open Science Framework) identified summaries or syntheses of guidelines for mental health care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the accuracy of the methods used in the OxPPL guidance by identifying any resources that the guidance had not included. Results: Overall, 80.2% (146/182) of the clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that the OxPPL guidance answered important clinical questions, 73.1% (133/182) stated that the guidance was relevant to their service, 59.3% (108/182) said that the guidelines had or would have a positive impact on their clinical practice, 42.9% (78/182) that they had shared or would share the guidance, and 80.2% (146/182) stated that the methodology could be used during future health crises. The focus groups found that the combination of evidence-based knowledge, clinical viewpoint, and visibility was crucial for clinical implementation. The systematic review identified 2543 records, of which 2 syntheses of guidelines met all the inclusion criteria, but only 1 (the OxPPL guidance) used evidence-based methodology. The review showed that the OxPPL guidance had included the majority of eligible guidelines, but 6 were identified that had not been included. Conclusions: The study identified an unmet need for web-based, evidence-based mental health care guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The OxPPL guidance was evaluated by clinicians as having a real-world clinical impact. Robust evidence-based methodology and expertise in mental health are necessary, but easy accessibility is also needed, and digital technology can materially help. Further health emergencies are inevitable and now is the ideal time to prepare, including addressing the training needs of clinicians, patients, and carers, especially in areas such as telepsychiatry and digital mental health. For future planning, guidance should be widely disseminated on an international platform, with allocated resources to support adaptive updates.

N2  - Accepting a new vaccine is influenced by several variables. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the use and non-use of the COVID-19 vaccine as well as the participants' perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, the study enabled us to ascertain the degree of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by the study population. This was cross-sectional research and UAE's general populace was surveyed for the study. A multi-national population of 671 people took part in the study and the information was gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. For categorical variables, the findings were expressed as frequencies and percentages; and for numerical variables, they were expressed as mean/median and standard deviation. To ascertain the relationship between independent and dependent variables, the Chi-square test was performed. Of the total participants in this trial, 627 (96.6%) received vaccinations; 160 (25.5%) experienced mild side effects, and 29 (18.1%) had severe side effects. Participants who were unwilling to receive the vaccination cited "No trust in the vaccine"as their main justification. Other explanations included allergies, pregnancy, vaccination side effects, and a lack of interest. The statistically significant associations observed with vaccination were, concern about the vaccine's side effects, precautions to ward off the virus, the belief that vaccination cannot prevent COVID-19, having had COVID-19, lack of confidence in the vaccine, and the belief that natural exposure to corona gives the safest protection. Among those who have received vaccinations, the majority disapproved or strongly disagreed with all the assertions made regarding the attitude. Among the people who aren't/weren't immunized, many agreed or strongly agreed with the assertions. More than 68% of people, regardless of vaccination status, agreed with the "pandemic impact on work"and "pandemic impact on income"; 59% of those who are vaccinated and 69% of those who do not, agreed with this statement. The observed immunization rate was 96.6%. The main deterrent to vaccination was a lack of trust in the vaccine. Other explanations included allergies, pregnancy, vaccination's side effects, and a lack of interest.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to examine the biological and psychological aspects of stress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we focused on hair cortisol levels reflecting the second and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, perceived stress, pregnancy-related anxiety associated with the fear of COVID-19. METHODS: The research sample comprised 40 pregnant women. The research tools consisted of a questionnaire battery: Perceived Stress Scale, Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire, Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Another employed research tool was the hair cortisol analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that pregnant women had higher hair cortisol levels in the 3rd trimester compared to the 2nd trimester (z=–2.850, p=0.004, r=–0.45). In regards to pregnancy-related anxiety, multiparous women had a higher score compared to primiparous women[t(28.81)=–2.90, p=0.007, d=0.48]. Perceived stress was negatively correlated with hair cortisol levels for the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (r=–0.366, p=0.01). There was no relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and pregnancy-related anxiety (r=0.301, p=0.059). CONCLUSION: We consider that it is important to focus on the prevention of stress and pregnancy-related anxiety, especially during various demanding societal changes, and thus mitigate the potential long-term negative effects of stress on pregnant women’s health and well-being.

Mental and physical health have different incidences among pregnant women, and they also have a higher risk for certain psychological conditions. Starting from the group's psychological profiler and clinical psychologist, we chose a set of questioners and analyzed a group of pregnant women enrolled in the pregnancy follow-up program by their family doctor/G.P. Starting from the test-retest method, we analyzed pregnancy from several psychological perspectives (depression, anxiety, and self-esteem) and set out to determine these fluctuations by trimester of pregnancy. We chose the test and retest method to establish the initial level of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem and applied the questionnaires in each trimester, trying to apply them in the midweek (+/-1 week) for each participant. All tests and questions indicated statistically significant increases of a worrying magnitude. An immediate priority of the scientific community should be collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and especially vulnerable groups such as pregnant women who were presented in this study.

N2  - Objective: We evaluated the protective effect of postpartum resilience (measured before the pandemic onset) on the prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: The sample included 589 mothers from a longitudinal study in southern Brazil. Three months after delivery we assessed maternal resilience through the Resilience Scale (RS). The Generalized Anxiety Disorders 7-item (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The prevalence of severe to moderate anxiety symptoms in this sample was 28.4% (95% CI: 25.0; 32.0). Resilience showed to be a protective factor against moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during the pandemic (OR: 0.98; p<0.001). Conclusions: The results showed that postpartum resilience is a factor associated with lower odds of a more intense manifestation of anxiety during pandemic periods. Thus, strengthening resilience by reinforcing appropriate coping strategies can prevent mental health problems.

N2  - To assess the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, investigators from the National Institutes of Health Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) research program developed the Pandemic-Related Traumatic Stress Scale (PTSS). Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) acute stress disorder symptom criteria, the PTSS is designed for adolescent (13–21 years) and adult self-report and caregiver-report on 3–12-year-olds. To evaluate psychometric properties, we used PTSS data collected between April 2020 and August 2021 from non-pregnant adult caregivers (n = 11,483), pregnant/postpartum individuals (n = 1,656), adolescents (n = 1,795), and caregivers reporting on 3–12-year-olds (n = 2,896). We used Mokken scale analysis to examine unidimensionality and reliability, Pearson correlations to evaluate relationships with other relevant variables, and analyses of variance to identify regional, age, and sex differences. Mokken analysis resulted in a moderately strong, unidimensional scale that retained nine of the original 10 items. We detected small to moderate positive associations with depression, anxiety, and general stress, and negative associations with life satisfaction. Adult caregivers had the highest PTSS scores, followed by adolescents, pregnant/postpartum individuals, and children. Caregivers of younger children, females, and older youth had higher PTSS scores compared to caregivers of older children, males, and younger youth, respectively.

N2  - Background: COVID 19 positive pregnantwomen form a very vulnerable group. It adversely affects their physical and psychological health. These women are likely to develop new health problems or aggravation of existing problems during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 100 consecutive Covid positive pregnant women who were admitted in the isolation wards of Government Medical College, Thrissur and delivered during the study period from 1st may 2021. These women were followed up till 6 months postpartum. Data was collected from recordsand bypersonal interview or telephonic call using astructuredquestionnaire. Demographic profile, Covid symptoms and their severity, obstetric details, breast feeding practices, neonatal outcomes and post Covid symptoms were studied. The association between breastfeeding, hygiene practices and neonatal positivity was also looked into/. Results: 51% of Covid positive pregnant women were asymptomatic. Nine women had severe Covid pneumonia with 2 of them requiring ventilatory support. There were no cases of vertical transmission or transmission through breastfeeding among the newborns studied. There was a strong association between strict adherence to hygienic practices and neonatal positivity. 24% of women had persistent symptoms at 6 months postpartum. Post exertion malaise was most commonly observed. Conclusion: Women with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may continue to have health problems and hence need a close follow up.

N2  - Adalimumab is the only approved biologic treatment for moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, nonetheless, long-term data from real-life setting are still limited. The objective of this observational multicenter study was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and drug survival of adalimumab in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa included in the BIOREP registry. A total of 299 patients who initiated adalimumab therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa from 2011 to November 2021 were included. The Dermatology-Life-Quality-Index (DLQI), pain scale, the number of abscesses, inflammatory nodules and draining tunnels, and International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) were recorded in the 0th, 3rd, and 6th months; then every 6 months during the ongoing adalimumab treatment. Studied patients underwent treatment for up to 48 months, with the average duration of treatment lasting 2.3 years. The mean age of the patients was 44.9 years, 79% were smokers or ex-smokers, 54.8% were obese, and 26.4% were overweight, the mean BMI was 30.8. The mean time from diagnosis to initiation adalimumab therapy was 9.1 years. The number of patients with severe IHS4 dropped from the initial 249 (83.3%) to 65 (30.1%) after 12 months and this trend was maintained up to the 48th month. A decreasing number of inflammatory lesions were rapid and sustained and correlated to the improvement of patients' quality of life, the mean DLQI score dropped from 17.6 to 8.5 after 3 months and to 5, 7 after 48 months. No unexpected risk signals were observed. Our long-term study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab in a real-life setting.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Women in Ohio Appalachia experience greater maternal health disparities relative to the general U.S. population, resulting in poorer health outcomes. This paper describes the Ohio Better Starts for All (BSFA) program that provides mobile maternal health services in rural Ohio. METHODS: This three-year intervention was delivered through a community-clinical partnership in Ohio Appalachia. The program's preliminary evaluation and opportunities were informed by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RESULTS: Over six months, 86 patients were referred to the BSFA program, 54 (62.8 %) were seen by the maternal care team, and 14 out of 19 scheduled clinic days were held. Five clinics were canceled due to inclement weather, mobile unit breakdown, or provider COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION: Maternal care providers must provide equitable care to patients, with particular attention to those who face substantial challenges accessing obstetric services. The BSFA program offers one promising solution to help women overcome barriers to accessing care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: to identify factors associated with fear of COVID-19 among women who experienced pregnancy or childbirth during the pandemic. METHODS: a cross-sectional study, nested within a prospective cohort, using an online survey, from August 2021 to February 2022, based on descriptive data analysis. RESULTS: of the 431 participants, 52.8% were postpartum women and 20.1% were pregnant women. With regard to fear of COVID-19, a mean score of 20.46 was obtained (moderate fear). The highest fear scores were present in women whose newborns were admitted to hospital in neonatal critical units (p=0.032), and the lowest among those covered by supplementary health (insurance) (p=0.016). CONCLUSION: among pregnant and postpartum women, high fear of COVID-19 translated into the possibility of having newborns admitted to hospital in a critical unit. The importance of supporting actions to support pregnant/postpartum women's mental health in relation to COVID-19 or other threats that may influence the neonatal outcome stands out.

N2  - Objective: This study explored the perspectives and behaviours of emergency physicians (EPs), regularly involved in resuscitation, to identify the sources and effects of any stress experienced during a resuscitation as well as the strategies employed to deal with these stressors. Methods: This was a two-centre sequential exploratory mixed-methods study of EPs consisting of a focus group, exploring the human factors related to resuscitation, and an anonymous survey. Between April and June 2020, the online survey was distributed to all EPs working at Australia's largest two major trauma centres, both in Melbourne, and investigated sources of stress during resuscitation, impact of stress on performance, mitigation strategies used, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and stress management training received. Associations with gender and years of clinical practice were also examined. Results: 7 EPs took part in the focus group and 82 responses to the online survey were received (81% response rate). The most common sources of stress reported were resuscitation of an 'unwell young paediatric patient' (81%, 95% CI 70.6 to 87.6) or 'unwell pregnant patient' (71%, 95% CI 60.1 to 79.5) and 'conflict with a team member' (71%, 95% CI 60.1 to 79.5). The most frequently reported strategies to mitigate stress were 'verbalising a plan to the team' (84%, 95% CI 74.7 to 90.5), 'implementing a standardised/ structured approach' (73%, 95% CI 62.7 to 81.6) and 'asking for help' (57%, 95% CI 46.5 to 67.5). 79% (95% CI 69.3 to 86.6) of EPs reported that they would like additional training on stress management. Junior EPs more frequently reported the use of 'mental rehearsal' to mitigate stress during a resuscitation (62% vs 22%; p<0.01) while female EPs reported 'asking for help' as a mitigator of stress more frequently than male EPs (79% vs 47%; p=0.01). Conclusions: Stress is commonly experienced by EPs during resuscitation and can impact decision-making and procedural performance. This study identifies the most common sources of stress during a resuscitation as well as the strategies that EPs use to mitigate the effects of stress on their performance. These findings may contribute to the development of tailored stress management training for critical care clinicians.

N2  - This technical report accompanies the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2022 to 2023 season. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age. Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, are cocirculating. This technical report summarizes recent influenza seasons, morbidity and mortality in children, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccination coverage, and provides detailed guidance on storage, administration, and implementation. The report also provides a brief background on inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccine recommendations, vaccination during pregnancy and breastfeeding, diagnostic testing, and antiviral medications for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. Updated information is provided about the 2021 to 2022 influenza season, influenza immunization rates, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on hospitalization and mortality, available vaccines, guidance for patients with history of severe allergic reactions to prior influenza vaccinations, and strategies to promote vaccine uptake.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to explore vaccination acceptance among individuals with a history of preterm birth between March and June during the pre-COVID (2019), early-COVID (2020), and late-COVID (2021) periods. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional, retrospective cohort study of pregnant individuals with a history of preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) who initiated care of a subsequent pregnancy during pre-COVID (March-June 2019), early-COVID (March-June 2020), or late-COVID (March-June 2021). The primary outcome of interest was vaccination status for influenza, Tdap, and COVID-19 vaccines. Fisher's exact and chi-square tests were used to investigate association between vaccination status and time periods, race/ethnicity, and insurance. Results: Among 293 pregnancies, influenza vaccination rate was highest in early-COVID (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in Tdap or COVID-19 vaccination between time periods. COVID-19 vaccination was highest in individuals with private insurance (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in vaccination status by race/ethnicity. Conclusion: In this study on high-risk pregnant individuals, the majority of our cohort remained unvaccinated against COVID-19 into the late-COVID period. Additionally, their influenza vaccination rates were greater than the national average in early-COVID and substantially lower than the national average in late-COVID. This shift in influenza vaccination acceptance may have been sparked by COVID-19 vaccine distribution beginning in January 2021 leading to overall vaccination hesitancy. Standardized guidelines and counseling concerning prenatal safety in recommended immunizations may serve as important tools of reassurance and health promotion.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Parental depression affects as many as 1 in 5 US families. Pediatric professionals can play an important role in detecting parental depression, yet most studies on parental depression screening focus only on the postpartum period. The authors performed this scoping review to understand the existing literature on parental depression screening outside the postpartum period (child >12 months old) and to identify knowledge gaps. METHODS: Sources for this research include PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and APA Psych Info. We included English language papers concerning screening for maternal and/or paternal depression or mood disorders outside of the postpartum period by pediatric clinicians or in a pediatric health care setting. Extracted variables included publication year, title, author(s), country, geographic setting, clinical setting, child age range (in years), parental focus, sample size, study type, approach, screening instrument(s), and findings. RESULTS: Forty-one papers were included. The proportion of positive parental depression screens was consistently high across the included studies. Relatively few structured screening programs outside of the postpartum period were identified, especially for fathers. The included studies suggest that screening can be accomplished in pediatric settings, but appropriate referral and follow-up of positive screens poses a major challenge. This review was limited to English language papers concerning parental depression outside of the postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that screening for parental depressive symptoms outside the postpartum period could identify families in need of support. Research is required to identify best practices for referral and follow-up of parents who screen positive.

N2  - Background Telemedicine for medical abortion care was rapidly introduced in Great Britain in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing body of literature demonstrates that telemedicine abortion care is safe, effective and highly acceptable to patients. Less is known about the perspectives of abortion care providers (ACPs). Methods Qualitative research within the telemedicine abortion service in Lothian (Edinburgh and surrounding region), UK. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with ACPs between May and July 2020 (doctors, n=6; nurses, n=10) and analysed the data thematically. Results We present three themes from our qualitative analysis: (1) Selective use of ultrasound - the move away from routine ultrasound for determination of gestational age was generally viewed positively. Initial anxiety about non-detection of ectopic pregnancy and later gestations was expressed by some ACPs, but concerns were addressed through clinical practice and support structures within the clinic. (2) Identifying safeguarding issues - in the absence of visual cues some ACPs reported concerns about their ability to identify safeguarding issues, specifically domestic violence. Conversely it was acknowledged that teleconsultations may improve detection of this in some situations. (3) Provision of information during the consultation - telephone consultations were considered more focused than in-person consultations and formed only part of the overall 'package' of information provided to patients, supplemented by online and written information. Conclusions ACPs providing telemedicine abortion care value this option for patients and believe it should remain beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Safeguarding patients and the selective use of ultrasound can be initially challenging; however, with experience, staff confidence improves.

N2  - Background The Scottish government introduced legislation during the COVID-19 outbreak to permit medical abortion at home with telemedicine. All women received an initial telephone consultation. For those choosing medical abortion, we provided self-administered medications to eligible women with pregnancies under 12 weeks' gestation. Aims To assess adherence to the recommended abortion drug regimen, with particular focus on the number of misoprostol doses used and the interval between mifepristone and misoprostol administration and the induction-expulsion interval. Additionally, to evaluate use of analgesia, antiemetics and antibiotics, and the side effects, pain and bleeding profile of medical abortion at home. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 663 women choosing medical abortion at home via telemedicine at an NHS abortion service in Edinburgh, Scotland between 1 April and 9 July 2020. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were completed at telephone follow-up 4 and 14 days following treatment. Outcome measures were self-reported and included use of mifepristone and misoprostol, induction-expulsion interval (time from misoprostol administration until expulsion of pregnancy), antiemetics, antibiotics, analgesia use, pain scores, rates of side effects, bleeding and preparedness for treatment. Results Among the respondents, 652/663 women (98%) answered at least one questionnaire, and 594/663 (89.6%) used both abortion medications as directed (24-72 hours between medications). The mean (SD) induction-expulsion interval was 4.3 (4.3) hours. Antiemetics were used by 611/663 (92%), 383/599 (64%) completed the course of prophylactic antibiotics, and 616/663 (93%) used analgesia, with mean (SD) worst-pain scores of 6.7 (2.2) out of 10. Regarding side effects, 510/663 (77%) experienced either nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or headache, 101/663 (15%) experienced headache and 510/663 (77%) experienced bleeding that was heavier than a period; 554/663, (84%) felt prepared for their treatment by teleconsultation. Conclusion Patients are able to correctly self-administer abortion medications following a telemedicine consultation. Further research is required to optimise pain management and gastrointestinal side effects during medical abortion.

N2  - Objective The primary objective of this study was to evaluate coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related changes in the antenatal utilization of high-risk obstetric services. Our secondary objective was to characterize change in stillbirth rate during the pandemic. Study Design This is a retrospective, observational study performed at a single, tertiary care center. Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) visits, ultrasounds, and antenatal tests of fetal well-being during the pandemic epoch (2020), which spans the first 12 weeks of the year to include pandemic onset and implementation of mitigation efforts, were compared with the same epoch of the three preceding years visually and using general linear models to account for week and year effect. An analysis of stillbirth rate comparing the pandemic time period to prepandemic was also performed. Results While there were decreased MFM visits and antenatal tests of fetal well-being during the pandemic epoch compared with prepandemic epochs, only the decrease in MFM visits by year was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The stillbirth rate during the pandemic epoch was not significantly different when compared with the prepandemic period and accounting for both week (p = 0.286) and year (p = 0.643) effect. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in MFM visits, whereas obstetric ultrasounds and antenatal tests of fetal well-being remained unchanged. While we observed no change in the stillbirth rate compared with the prepandemic epoch, our study design and sample size preclude us from making assumptions of association. Our findings may support future work investigating how changes in prenatal care for high-risk obstetric patients influence perinatal outcomes. Key Points MFM visits significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic epoch. The overall stillbirth rate during the COVID-19 pandemic epoch was not significantly changed. Larger studies are needed to capitalize on these changes to evaluate rare outcomes such as stillbirth.

N2  - Background Pandemics often precipitate declines in essential health service utilisation, which can ultimately kill more people than the disease outbreak itself. There is some evidence, however, that the presence of adequately supported community health workers (CHWs), that is, financially remunerated, trained, supplied and supervised in line with WHO guidelines, may blunt the impact of health system shocks. Yet, adequate support for CHWs is often missing or uneven across countries. This study assesses whether adequately supported CHWs can maintain the continuity of essential community-based health service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Interrupted time series analysis. Monthly routine data from 27 districts across four countries in sub-Saharan Africa were extracted from CHW and facility reports for the period January 2018-June 2021. Descriptive analysis, null hypothesis testing, and segmented regression analysis were used to assess the presence and magnitude of a possible disruption in care utilisation after the earliest reported cases of COVID-19. Results CHWs across all sites were supported in line with the WHO Guideline and received COVID-19 adapted protocols, training and personal protective equipment within 45 days after the first case in each country. We found no disruptions to the coverage of proactive household visits or integrated community case management (iCCM) assessments provided by these prepared and protected CHWs, as well as no disruptions to the speed with which iCCM was received, pregnancies were registered or postnatal care received. Conclusion CHWs who were equipped and prepared for the pandemic were able to maintain speed and coverage of community-delivered care during the pandemic period. Given that the majority of CHWs globally remain unpaid and largely unsupported, this paper suggests that the opportunity cost of not professionalising CHWs may be larger than previously estimated, particularly in light of the inevitability of future pandemics.

N2  - Purpose The Women Aware with Their Children study was created because prospective data are required to accurately guide prevention programmes for intimate partner violence (IPV) and to improve the mental health and resettlement trajectories of women from refugee backgrounds in Australia. Participants 1335 women (685 consecutively enrolled from refugee backgrounds and 650 randomly selected Australian-born) recruited during pregnancy from three public antenatal clinics in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. The mean age was 29.7 years among women from refugee backgrounds and 29.0 years among women born in the host nation. Main measures include IPV, mood, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder, disability and living difficulties. Findings to date Prevalence of IPV at all three time points is significantly higher for refugee-background women. The trend data showed that reported IPV rates among Australian-born women increased from 25.8% at time 1 to 30.1% at time 3, while for refugee-background women this rate declined from 44.4% at time 1 to 42.6% at time 3. Prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at all three time points is higher for refugee-background women. MDD among Australian-born women significantly declined from 14.5% at time 1 to 9.9% at time 3, while for refugee-background women it fluctuated from 25.1% at time 1 to 17.3% at time 2 and to 19.1% at time 3. Future plans We are currently examining trajectories of IPV and mental disorder across four time points. Time 4 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of the pandemic over time. Time 5 started in August 2021 and time 6 will begin approximately 12 months later. The children at time 5 are in the early school years, providing the capacity to examine behaviour, development and well-being of the index child.

N2  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been recommended to pregnant women, but survey studies showed contrasting findings worldwide in relation to the willingness to accept vaccination during pregnancy. Objective: To evaluate the evidence from the literature regarding the acceptance rate of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Study design: We performed a systematic review on the main databases (MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, ISI Web of Science) searching for all the peer-reviewed survey studies analyzing the eventual acceptance rate of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among pregnant and breastfeeding women. To combine data meta-analyses of proportions and pooled proportions with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: 15 studies including 25,839 women were included in the analysis. The proportion of women actually willing to be vaccinated during pregnancy is 49.1% (95% CI, 42.3–56.0), and the proportion of breastfeeding women is 61.6% (95% CI, 50.0–75.0). Conclusion: The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance rate among pregnant women appears still low. Vaccinal campaign are urgently needed to drive more confidence into the vaccine to help reducing the spread of the infection and the possible consequences during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction Physician burnout has severe consequences on clinician well-being. Residents face numerous work-stressors that can contribute to burnout; however, given specialty variation in work-stress, it is difficult to identify systemic stressors and implement effective burnout interventions on an institutional level. Assessing resident preferences by specialty for common wellness interventions could also contribute to improved efficacy. Methods This cross-sectional study used best–worst scaling (BWS), a type of discrete choice modelling, to explore how 267 residents across nine specialties (anaesthesiology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynaecology, pathology, psychiatry, radiology and surgery) prioritised 16 work-stressors and 4 wellness interventions at a large academic medical centre during the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020). Results Top-ranked stressors were work-life integration and electronic health record documentation. Therapy (63%, selected as’would realistically consider intervention’) and coaching (58%) were the most preferred wellness supports in comparison to group-based peer support (20%) and individual peer support (22%). Pathology, psychiatry and OBGYN specialties were most willing to consider all intervention options, with emergency medicine and internal medicine specialties least willing to consider intervention options. Conclusion BWS can identify relative differences in surveyed stressors, allowing for the generation of specialty-specific stressor rankings and preferences for specific wellness interventions that can be used to drive institution-wide changes to improve clinician wellness. BWS surveys are a potential methodology for clinician wellness programmes to gather specific information on preferences to determine best practices for resident wellness.

N2  - Aim of the Study: There is currently no meta-synthesis focused on the lived experiences of health-care providers during COVID-19. This meta-synthesis adds to evidence-based literature with an in-depth exploration of how health-care providers responded to the COVID-19 crisis. Materials and Methods: The meta-synthesis approach was used for the extraction and synthesis of data. Results: Fifteen qualitative research articles were identified and analyzed; the majority of which were done in China 7 (48%) and Iran 6 (40%). The total sample size was 383, and the majority of the samples were nurses 282 (74%). Three overarching themes identified were “It is my duty,” “I am exhausted and about to fall,” and “I have overcome it.” The subthemes were professional responsibility, challenges faced, the unexpected burden at work, self-coping and reflection, hospital support, government support, and social support. Conclusion: The recommendations for the policy-makers, put forward by the current study are; designing and engineering effective personal protective equipment (lightweight protective suit with long-lasting durable diapers and face masks with a portal for drinking juice or water), rostering minimal working hours, live-in care facilities, exclusion of pregnant and sick health care providers during an epidemic assignment and frequent outbreak training sessions for all department staff.

N2  - Background: The early postpartum period is recognized cross-culturally as being important for recovery, with new parents receiving increased levels of community support. However, COVID-19-related lockdown measures may have disrupted these support systems, with possible implications for mental health. Here, we use a cross-sectional analysis among individuals who gave birth at different stages of the pandemic to test (i) if instrumental support access in the form of help with household tasks, newborn care, and care for older children has varied temporally across the pandemic, and (ii) whether access to these forms of instrumental support is associated with lower postpartum depression scores. Methods: This study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant persons in the United States. Participants completed postnatal surveys between April 30 – November 18, 2020 (n = 971). Logistic regression analysis tested whether birth timing during the pandemic was associated with odds of reported sustained instrumental support. Linear regression analyses assessed whether instrumental support was associated with lower depression scores as measured via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression survey. Results: Participants who gave birth later in the pandemic were more likely to report that the pandemic had not affected the help they received with household work and newborn care (p < 0.001), while access to childcare for older children appeared to vary non-linearly throughout the pandemic. Additionally, respondents who reported that the pandemic had not impacted their childcare access or help received around the house displayed significantly lower depression scores compared to participants who reported pandemic-related disruptions to these support types (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The maintenance of postpartum instrumental support during the pandemic appears to be associated with better maternal mental health. Healthcare providers should therefore consider disrupted support systems as a risk factor for postpartum depression and ask patients how the pandemic has affected support access. Policymakers seeking to improve parental wellbeing should design strategies that reduce disease transmission, while facilitating safe interactions within immediate social networks (e.g., through investment in COVID-19 testing and contact tracing). Cumulatively, postpartum instrumental support represents a potential tool to protect against depression, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - It has been reported that frontline health professionals have suffered from an increased rate of mental disorders as a consequence of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of Spanish specialists in the obstetrics and gynecology fields after the fifth Spanish COVID‐19 wave. Methods: Psychometric screening of the professionals was performed using a nationwide online survey designed by the Psychosocial Obstetrics and Gynecology taskforce. Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and general anxiety disorder were screened. Results: We found high scores for PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. Up to 12.4% of specialists met the PTSD criteria, 12.8% showed complex PTSD, 37% showed depression, and up to 37% had a positive screening for generalized anxiety disorder. Our results showed that the pandemic has particularly affected the group of female Ob‐ Gyn specialists, with significant higher scores in depression and anxiety scales. Conclusions: As a lesson learned for the future in case of new health emergencies, it would be very important to pro-vide professionals with adequate psychological support, ensuring enough human and material re-sources, flexible work shifts, and facilities to reconcile work and family‐life, especially in the case of female specialists.

N2  - Objective. To determine the effectiveness of the method and patient satisfaction after performing a medical abortion to terminate a pregnancy in the first trimester. Methods. In a retrospective analysis, we present the experiences in performing medical abortion at our clinic in the period from October 1, 2020 to October 1, 2021. Mifepristone tablets and misoprostol tablets were administered according to a scheme, adapted to the protocol of the World Health Organization. Results. In a period of one year at our clinic, we treated 189 patients with the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol in order to terminate a pregnancy in the first trimester. Instrumental revision due to residual masses in the uterus after two weeks was performed in 8 patients (4.23%) while the procedure was repeated successfully in 2 patients (1.06%). The efficiency of the method was 95.8%. We had a small number of complications (prolonged genital bleeding, transient fever, vomiting, etc.). Total of 91.4% of respondents were satisfied with the method. Conclusion. Medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy is a safe, effective method and especially useful due to the COVID-19 pandemic, because it can be used without hospitalization, within the ambulatory environment, in consultation with the attending gynecologist.

N2  - Background: Given that pregnant women are now included among those for receipt coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, it is important to ensure that information systems can be used (or available) for active safety surveillance, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to build consensus about the use of existing maternal and neonatal data collection systems in LMICs for COVID-19 vaccines active safety surveillance, a basic set of variables, and the suitability and feasibility of including pregnant women and LMIC research networks in COVID-19 vaccines pre-licensure activities. Methods: A three-stage modified Delphi study was conducted over three months in 2020. An international multidisciplinary panel of 16 experts participated. Ratings distributions and consensus were assessed, and ratings’ rationale was analyzed. Results: The panel recommended using maternal and neonatal data collection systems for active safety surveillance in LMICs (median 9; disagreement index [DI] -0.92), but there was no consensus (median 6; DI 1.79) on the feasibility of adapting these systems. A basic set of 14 maternal, neonatal, and vaccination-related variables. Out of 16 experts, 11 supported a basic set of 14 maternal, neonatal, and vaccination-related variables for active safety surveillance. Seven experts agreed on a broader set of 26 variables. The inclusion of pregnant women for COVID-19 vaccines research (median 8; DI -0.61) was found appropriate, although there was uncertainty on its feasibility in terms of decision-makers’ acceptability (median 7; DI 10.00) and regulatory requirements (median 6; DI 0.51). There was no consensus (median 6; DI 2.35) on the feasibility of including research networks in LMICs for conducting clinical trials amongst pregnant women. Conclusions: Although there was some uncertainty regarding feasibility, experts recommended using maternal and neonatal data collection systems and agreed on a common set of variables for COVID-19 vaccines active safety surveillance in LMICs.

N2  - Objective: The present study aimed to describe the common symptoms and diagnosis for each specialty which can be used in future for expansion of teleconsultation services and implementation of the E Sanjeevani model in health care. Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study which comprises the data collected from various specialties over a 4-month period. The telemedicine consultations were given by the consultants of the concerned specialty in adherence to the telemedicine guidelines issued by the government and mostly generic names of the medicine were advised to the patients. The demographic details, chief complaint of the patient, diagnosis, and treatment were recorded. Results: The total number of calls which was received in 4 months period at the telemedicine center in Government Medical College, Ayodhya, was 4848. Maximum number of calls was attended by the department of obstetrics and gynecology which was 771 (15.9%). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had a substantial and transformative influence on routine clinical practice across the entire clinical continuum in a very short period of time. Conclusion: The use of telemedicine emerged as a critical tool to improve the provision of health services. The virtual media and other technologies that can be delivered to patients doorsteps need to strengthened. The trailer which telemedicine showed up in times of COVID-19 can definitely produce a good show in days to come with proper communication between the service provider and receiver.

N2  - Although the psychological and psychiatric implications seem to be a central core of health problems during an emergency, they tend to be underestimated and neglected, generating gaps in intervention strategies and increasing the burden of associated diseases. Moreover, pharmacological treatment concerns arise for psychiatrists and the other specialists who deal with psychiatric patients affected by an infectious disease or with patients with an infectious disease that may develop a number of psychiatric symptoms. The mental health consequences of a pandemic may be related to the sequelae of the disease itself or to the preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of infections. In addition, fear of death, drastic changes in family organization and work routines, closings of schools, companies and public places can play a role. Furthermore, stress derived from working activity or economic losses should not be underestimated. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, first studies have shown the presence of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general population, health-care workers, and people affected by COVID-19. It appears likely that there will be substantial increases in a broad range of other mental disorders, suicide, behavioral disorders, loneliness, domestic violence and child abuse. From these considerations, the evaluation and monitoring of psychological/psychiatric conditions of involved populations, and the provision of focused aid must be part of the care intervention during the initial stage of a pandemic and beyond. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence on how mental health outcomes of COVID-19 outbreak have been measured and managed.
