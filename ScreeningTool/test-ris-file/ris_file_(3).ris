AB  - Background: Lack of mental health literacy among rehabilitation professionals and employers in the return-to-work of persons with mental health problems resulted in the development of a three-day group training program, the Support to Employers from rehabilitation Actors about Mental health (SEAM) intervention. Objective: To evaluate the impact of SEAM on rehabilitation professionals’ knowledge and beliefs, attitudes, and supporting behaviors towards people with mental health problems and employers as part of the return-to-work process. Methods: In this longitudinal study, 94 rehabilitation professionals were included. Data were collected prior to (T1), immediately after (T2) and 6 months after SEAM training (T3) using knowledge and attitude scales and a questionnaire on supporting behaviors. SEAM includes training in Mental Health First Aid, presentations and discussions on current research on work and mental health, and strategies and communication guidelines to use when meeting service users and employers as part of the return-to-work of persons with mental health problems. SEAM also includes a homepage with targeted employer information. Data were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. Results: SEAM significantly increased rehabilitation professionals’ knowledge of mental health (T1-T2: z = –2.037, p = 0.042; T2-T3: z = –5.093, p = 0.001), and improved their attitudes towards persons with mental health problems (T1-T2: z = 4.984, p = 0.001). Professionals (50–60%) also estimated that they had increased their use of supporting strategies towards service users and employers. Conclusions: The study suggests that SEAM can increase mental health literacy among rehabilitation professionals and lead to a greater focus on service users’ resources and work ability, as well as on employers’ support needs.

AB  - This is a qualitative descriptive study of professionals’ perceptions of facilitators and barriers for returning to work for women on long-term sick leave due to musculoskeletal pain and/or common mental disorder who participated in a vocational rehabilitation project. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 13 purposefully selected professionals from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Public Employment Service, the health care services, and the municipal services. The interviews were analyzed with a manifest content analysis. The main facilitators were the close cooperation between the professionals and the individual support that was offered to the project participants. The main barriers were differences among the stakeholders’ missions and goals, limitations in project duration and within the labor market, and the project participants’ personal factors. These results emphasize the importance of cooperation between the various stakeholder professionals and a focus on the individual’s resources and needs. The study highlights the value of including health care professionals in vocational rehabilitation to benefit from their specific knowledge of the target group and that group’s strengths and needs. Moreover, the study highlights the need to incorporate collaboration with employers and align with the local labor market in the development of vocational rehabilitation interventions.

AB  - Purpose: To study return to work (RTW) at 2-year follow-up in a randomised controlled trial comparing brief intervention (BI) and multidisciplinary intervention (MDI) in employees on sick leave due to low back pain (LBP) stratified for job relations. Methods: In total 476 employees on sick leave for 4–12 weeks due to LBP were divided into strata with weak or strong job relations, based on perceived risk of losing job and influence on job planning. In each stratum participants were allocated to BI or MDI. All participants received BI, i.e. a clinical examination by a rheumatologist and physiotherapist. In addition, MDI involved a case manager who made a rehabilitation plan in collaboration with the participant. The primary outcome was time to RTW. Secondary outcomes were median weeks in different employment status and self-reported pain, disability and psychological health. Sustained RTW was estimated by work status the last 4 weeks before the 2-year date. Results: Participants with strong job relations who received BI had a higher RTW rate (hazard ratio = 0.74 (95% CI 0.57; 0.96)) and spent more weeks working than participants who received MDI. In the stratum of weak job relations, no difference was seen regarding RTW and weeks working. For health-related outcomes and sustained RTW no significant results were found in neither stratum. Conclusions: Employees with strong job relations achieved higher RTW rates when receiving BI compared to MDI, while no difference was found between intervention groups for employees with weak job relations.
