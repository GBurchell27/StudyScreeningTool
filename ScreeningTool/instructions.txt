Nextjs frontend, python backend. I want to build a tool to help screen papers for a systematic review. The inputs will be a RIS file (containing meta data of the studies) and the user's inclusion and exclusion criteria. The API will send the RIS file along with the user’s inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The idea is:
1) The RIS file is parsed into individual studies meta data (using rispy)
2) individual studies’ Title, Abstract and Keywords (tiabkw). 
3) The tiabkw of each study is sent to chatGPT one at a time where the agent makes the decision on wether to either INCLUDE, MAYBE or EXCLUDE that study based on specific inclusion and or exclusion criteria. 

Can you think along from a top down approach wether this is possible and suggest some additional steps or steps I may have not thought about.”
