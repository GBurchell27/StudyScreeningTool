Areas for Improvement:
    ⭕Frontend needs proper error handling and loading states
    ⭕Could add file size validation before upload
    ⭕Could implement batch processing for large RIS files
    ⭕Could add logging for debugging and monitoring

1) Frontend (file-upload.tsx):
    ✅Validates file extension (.ris)
    ✅Need to implement actual file upload using fetch/axios to backend
    ✅Error handling

2) Backend (main.py):
    ✅Receives file and validates extension again (double validation is good!)
    ✅Reads file content
    ✅Generates unique job_id for tracking
    ✅Handles HTTP errors appropriately

3) Validation Layer (validation.py):
    ✅Acts as a coordinator
    ✅Checks for empty results
    ✅Wraps parsing errors in validation context
    ✅Good: Separates validation concerns from parsing

4) Parsing & Validation (risfileparsing.py):
    ✅Does both parsing and field-level validation
    ✅Normalizes data (stripping whitespace, etc.)
    ✅Validates required fields and data types
    ✅Good: Combines parsing and validation in one pass

5) Database Layer (database.py):
    ✅Stores validated and parsed entries
    ✅Adds metadata like job_id
    ✅Handles database errors gracefully
    ✅Good: Keeps track of stored count

6) Update the frontend:
     Show loading state during upload
     Handle the response and update the studies context
     Display any errors
     Display upload success message to the center panel "Studies Overview" card.
