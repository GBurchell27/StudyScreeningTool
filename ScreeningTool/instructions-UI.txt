Front End UI

This tool to help screen papers for a systematic review. The inputs will be a RIS file (containing meta data of the studies) and the user's inclusion and exclusion criteria. The API will send the RIS file along with the user’s inclusion/exclusion criteria to the backend (to be coded later).
